Four ways Bob Corker skewered Donald Trump,"Image copyright Getty Images
On Sunday morning, Donald Trump went off on a Twitter tirade against a member of his own party.
This, in itself, isn't exactly huge news. It's far from the first time the president has turned his rhetorical cannons on his own ranks.
This time, however, his attacks were particularly biting and personal. He essentially called Tennessee Senator Bob Corker, the chair of the powerful Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a coward for not running for re-election.
He said Mr Corker ""begged"" for the president's endorsement, which he refused to give. He wrongly claimed that Mr Corker's support of the Iranian nuclear agreement was his only political accomplishment.
Unlike some of his colleagues, Mr Corker - free from having to worry about his immediate political future - didn't hold his tongue.
Skip Twitter post by @SenBobCorker It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning. — Senator Bob Corker (@SenBobCorker) October 8, 2017 Report
That wasn't the end of it, though. He then spoke with the New York Times and really let the president have it. Here are four choice quotes from the Tennessee senator's interview with the Times and why they are particularly damning.
""I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true. You know he does it, everyone knows he does it, but he does.""
You can't really sugarcoat this one. Mr Corker is flat-out saying the president is a liar - and everyone knows it.
The senator, in particular, is challenging Mr Trump's insistence that he unsuccessfully pleaded for his endorsement, but the accusation is much broader.
Mr Corker and the president used to be something akin to allies. The Tennessean was on Mr Trump's short list for vice-president and secretary of state.

Those days are seemingly very much over now - and it's not like Mr Corker is going anywhere anytime soon. Although he's not running for re-election, he'll be in the Senate, chairing a powerful committee, until January 2019.
The president's margin for success in that chamber is razor-thin. If Democrats can continue to stand together in opposition, he can afford to lose only two votes out of 52 Republican senators. That's why healthcare reform collapsed in July - and it could be bad news for tax efforts.
From here on out, Mr Corker isn't going to do the president any favours.
""Look, except for a few people, the vast majority of our caucus understands what we're dealing with here.""
Frustration in Congress has been growing over what Republicans feel has been the president's inability to focus on advancing their agenda. Getting a sharply divided party to come together on plans to repeal Obamacare, reform taxes or boost infrastructure spending is challenging enough. Doing so when the president stirs up unrelated controversies on a seemingly daily basis makes things all the harder.
One of the president's gifts has been his ability to shake off negative stories by quickly moving on to a different subject. That worked brilliantly during his presidential campaign, but it's less effective during the legislative slow grind.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Corker at the confirmation hearing for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson
For months, Republicans in Congress have been grumbling about this in the background and among themselves. Occasionally, someone like Mr McConnell will lament that the president doesn't understand how the Senate works.
Mr Corker has now stated it loud and clear. And, what's more, he says almost everyone agrees with him. They've kept silent until now because they still hope to pass conservative legislation that the president can sign or fear Mr Trump's legions will back a primary challenge next year or stay home during the general election.
If that calculus ever changes - if it becomes riskier to stay silent than speak out - Mr Trump will be in real trouble.
""A lot of people think that there is some kind of 'good cop, bad cop' act underway, but that's just not true.""
Time and again, Mr Trump has appeared to undercut Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and others in his administration who are attempting to use soft diplomacy to deal with a range of international crises.
The war against the Taliban in Afghanistan, Iran's compliance with the multinational nuclear agreement, the ongoing dispute between Qatar and its Persian Gulf neighbours, the unrest in Venezuela and, most recently, North Korea's continued ballistic missile tests have all been the target of the president's offhand remarks and Twitter invective.
Some administration defenders have said this is all a part of Mr Trump's strategy - an updated version of the Nixon-era ""madman theory"", in which the president forces adversaries to give way because they fear an unpredictable US leader's actions.
Mr Corker isn't buying it. There's no strategy, he says, just the possibility of chaos - which he hopes Mr Trump's senior advisers will be able to avoid.
""I know for a fact that every single day at the White House, it's a situation of trying to contain him.""
There's now a growing collection of John Kelly face-palm photos that serve as a testament to the chief-of-staff's reported frustration at dealing with the president.
Mr Trump goes off-script to praise torch-bearing white nationalists at a rally in Charlottesville, and Mr Kelly is captured closing his eyes and rubbing the arch of his nose, as if attempting to stave off a migraine.

The president calls North Korean leaders ""criminals"" in a speech to the United Nations, and Mr Kelly straight-up buries his face in his hands.
The White House communications team is often left scrambling to try to explain or reframe an indelicate presidential ""joke"" or remark that directly contradicts what was until then the official administration line.
Even though Mr Kelly has brought some discipline to the West Wing staff, the president still marches to the beat of his own drum - and continues to have unfettered access to his phone's Twitter app.

"Linklater's war veteran comedy speaks to modern America, says star","LONDON (Reuters) - “Last Flag Flying”, a comedy-drama about Vietnam war veterans, will resonate with Trump’s America, despite, or perhaps because of, its period setting, actor Bryan Cranston said on Sunday after a screening at the London Film Festival.
Set in the United States in December 2003 – when U.S. forces in Iraq were dragging Saddam Hussein out of a “spider hole” - it is the story of three ageing former servicemen who reunite to bury the son of one of them who has been killed in action.
With President Donald Trump saying he could “totally destroy” North Korea and characterizing a dinner with military commanders as “the calm before the storm”, Cranston said “Last Flag Flying” was a timely reminder of the effect on normal Americans of ill-advised military campaigns.
“I think it has a lot of relevance today in the sense that (today) it’s not clear cut as far as the (what are the) intentions of the government or military,” Cranston, acclaimed for his lead role in the TV drama “Breaking Bad”, told Reuters.
“In World War Two, it was the ‘good war’, it was clear and present danger, we had to stop this mad man. Since then, with Vietnam and Iraq, (there are) a lot of questions ... among the troops and the citizens as to if we are doing the right thing and what is the purpose of our being there.”
Cast member Bryan Cranston (R) and director Richard Linklater pose with festival director Claire Stewart as they arrive for the premiere of ""Last Flag Flying"" during the British Film Institute (BFI) London Film Festival at the Odeon, Leicester Square, in London, Britain October 8, 2017. REUTERS/Afolabi Sotunde
“Last Flag Flying” was produced by Amazon Studios and directed and co-written by Richard Linklater, whose greatest critical acclaim has been for the naturalistic “Before Sunset” trilogy and the 2014 “Boyhood” which won a slew of Oscar nominations.
Linklater also made comedies including “School of Rock” and “Everybody Wants Some!!”, about skirt-chasing undergraduates. “Last Flag Flying” falls somewhere between the two genres.

The drama and comedy stem from the chemistry between the three leads, each played by a big Hollywood name.
Steve Carell is the awkward shy one who, we assume, was quiet and withdrawn even before the loss of his son. Cranston plays a foul-mouthed, hard-drinking bar owner who is his own best customer, and Laurence Fishburne, is a man who has found God and become an evangelical preacher, preferring to forget the sex and drugs they all indulged in back in ‘Nam.
Vanity Fair’s Richard Lawson said the film’s ability to honor the footsoldiers while being critical of the wars they are sent to fight, could hit “an Academy sweet spot, satisfying both the more conservative oldsters and the younger, leftier types.”
Other critics said “Last Flag Flying” lacked the light touch of Linklater’s best work. The Guardian’s Benjamin Lee called it “a half-baked TV movie masquerading as Oscarbait, a curious misstep for the Oscar-nominated indie auteur”.

Trump’s Fight With Corker Jeopardizes His Legislative Agenda,"The feud broke into public view last week when Mr. Corker said that Mr. Trump’s advisers were guarding against “chaos.” The president retaliated on Sunday by saying the retiring senator “didn’t have the guts to run” for another term. Mr. Corker responded on Twitter an hour later, saying that the White House had become an “adult day care center.”
He then unloaded in an interview with The New York Times, saying in public what many of his Republican colleagues say in private — that the president is dangerously erratic, treats his high office like “a reality show,” has to be contained by his staff and is reckless enough to put the country “on the path to World War III.”
Mr. Corker, a moderate by temperament as well as ideology, had measured his occasional criticisms of Mr. Trump for months in hopes of influencing his foreign policy, but evidently feels liberated now that he has decided not to run for a third term.
Few other incumbent Republicans rushed to the microphones to echo his comments on Monday, but several made little attempt to hide their irritation at Mr. Trump for attacking Mr. Corker.
“He’s an important part of our team, and he’s a particularly important part of the budget debate, which will be on the floor next week,” Mr. McConnell said pointedly at an event in Hazard, Ky., with Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency.
“Bob Corker has been a leader in Congress on issues as diverse as deficit reduction and combating terrorism, and he is a man of unwavering integrity,” Senator Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said in a statement. “If we’re going to accomplish our economic and national security agenda we’re going to have to work together, period.”
Mr. McConnell’s associates were blunter in expressing the leadership’s frustration with the president for disrupting party unity as Republicans push for tax cuts. “This was going to be hard no matter what,” said Billy Piper, Mr. McConnell’s former chief of staff. “And he took the guy who was one of the linchpins of this and incinerated him for no reason.”

The White House spent Monday telling allies that Mr. Corker was responsible for the fight, not Mr. Trump, and that the senator was an attention-seeking obstructionist.

“I find tweets like this to be incredibly irresponsible,” Kellyanne Conway, the president’s counselor, told Fox News, referring to Mr. Corker’s posted response to Mr. Trump on Sunday. “It adds to the insulting that the mainstream media and the president’s detractors — almost a year after this election, they still can’t accept the election results. It adds to their ability and their cover to speak about the president of the United States in ways that no president should be talked about.”
Vice President Mike Pence was left to defend Mr. Trump against what he called “empty rhetoric and baseless attacks,” saying the president had accomplished a lot internationally. “Today our nation once again stands without apology as leader of the free world,” Mr. Pence said in a statement. “That’s what American leadership on the world stage looks like and no amount of criticism at home can diminish those results.”
Mr. Trump has grown frustrated by Senate Republicans — including lashing out at Mr. McConnell for not getting the job done — as legislation to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care program has been repeatedly blocked. He has engaged in open conflicts with Senators John McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, among others, although just Monday he went golfing with Mr. Graham.
Some Republican senators share Mr. Trump’s frustration with gridlock in the Senate. “We want things to move quickly,” said Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who was elected in 2014. “People are frustrated with the lack of results.”
Senator David Perdue of Georgia, another member of the 2014 class, has been even more outspoken in venting about fellow Republicans derailing health care legislation. “People are very upset that Republican senators are not backing the agenda of this president,” he said.
Mr. Trump’s former chief strategist, Stephen K. Bannon, acting in what he says is the president’s interest, is organizing a rebellion against the Republican establishment and recruiting candidates to challenge incumbent senators in primaries next year. “This is what they think about President Trump behind closed doors,” Mr. Bannon said on Fox News on Monday night, referring to Mr. Corker’s comments and calling on the senator to resign. Mr. Pence’s chief of staff has talked about a “purge” of Republicans who are not loyal to Mr. Trump.
That may keep more Republicans on board even if they agree with Mr. Corker.
“Do most senators have their doubts about the president?” asked John Feehery, a longtime Republican congressional aide. “That’s probably true, but also largely irrelevant. He’s the president, and they have to find ways to get stuff done with him. Otherwise, they face the wrath of the voters — something Bob Corker no longer worries about.”
In effect, Mr. McCain, Ms. Murkowski and Senator Susan Collins of Maine already were free agents on many issues. Regular defections by Mr. Corker would make the president’s ability to pass legislation that much harder, absent bipartisan deals with Democrats.

As chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Mr. Corker could block the confirmation of a new secretary of state should Mr. Trump push out his embattled chief diplomat, Rex W. Tillerson. He also, presumably, would play a key role in any decision on whether to tear up the Iran nuclear deal.
“Senate Republicans’ frustrations with Trump are starting to boil over,” said Alex Conant, a former Senate Republican aide. “I’m sure the feelings are mutual inside the White House. The relationship was always tenuous at best, but Corker’s comments are a new low point.”
“If they were getting a lot done, it would be easier for everyone to get along,” Mr. Conant said. “Of course, the fact that they’re not getting along also makes it harder to get anything done.”",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/us/politics/corkers-blast-at-trump-has-other-republicans-nodding-in-agreement.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics

Kansas Tried a Tax Plan Similar to Trump’s. It Failed.,"In 2012, Kansas lawmakers, led by Gov. Sam Brownback, a Republican, enacted a tax cut that eliminated state income taxes entirely for pass-through entities — such as sole proprietorships and limited liability partnerships — which are taxed at the owner’s individual income tax rate. The law also lowered individual income tax rates, cutting the top rate to 4.9 percent from 6.4 percent.
The tax package reduced state revenue by nearly $700 million a year, a drop of about 8 percent, from 2013 through 2016, according to the Kansas Legislative Research Department, forcing officials to shorten school calendars, delay highway repairs and reduce aid to the poor. Research suggests the package did not stimulate the economy, certainly not enough to pay for the tax cut. This year, legislators passed a bill to largely rescind the law, saying it had not worked as intended.
“It caused a lot of budget instability,” said State Senator Jim Denning, a Republican who led the effort to repeal the pass-through exemption this year. Mr. Denning, who earns pass-through income from his interest in a commercial real estate firm, said he had personally benefited from the exemption, but the state’s economy had not.
The pass-through exemption was responsible for $200 million to $300 million of that annual shortfall, according to budget researchers at the Tax Foundation in Washington. Between 2012 and 2015, the total number of Kansans claiming pass-through income grew 20 percent, to about 393,000 from about 330,000. A team of researchers from the University of South Carolina and other institutions who studied the impact of the tax change found the top 2 percent of Kansas earners reaped the largest gains from shifting income to pass-throughs.
Participation at the federal level could be far more dramatic — with tax benefits dwarfing those enjoyed in Kansas. The top income tax rate in Kansas before the 2012 law was 6.4 percent. This year, it will be 5.2 percent, growing to 5.7 percent in 2018. The top federal rate is 39.6 percent, offering a significantly bigger incentive for tax avoidance if pass-throughs are taxed at 25 percent. Already, 70 percent of pass-through income flows to the top 1 percent of American income earners, Owen Zidar, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, has found.
Republicans are considering lowering the top individual tax rate to 35 percent, but Mr. Trump has said he would maintain a higher rate on top earners in an effort to keep the income tax structure as progressive as it is now.

“The experience of Kansas shows that lawmakers should be cautious about taxing income from pass-through businesses at different rates than wages and salaries,” said Scott Greenberg, a senior analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation in Washington, which models tax proposals’ likely effects on the economy. A pass-through cut, he added, would probably produce less growth than many other, less expensive tax policy changes.

Republicans say they will erect guardrails to prevent workers from reclassifying themselves as contractors to exploit the lower rate. But their plan does not provide specifics, and tax experts say it will be difficult to restrict high-income individuals from diverting income through a pass-through.
Pass-throughs have long been favored by small businesses such as dental offices and family farms, but their use has expanded to include many financial and real estate firms. Mr. Trump’s business empire is largely run through hundreds of pass-through companies. The structure is also popular among consultants and other high-earning independent contractors; former President Bill Clinton, for example, receives payment for speeches through a pass-through entity.

Using a random sample of state tax returns, Jason DeBacker of the University of South Carolina Darla Moore School of Business, Bradley Heim and Justin M. Ross of Indiana University, and Shanthi Ramnath of the Treasury Department isolated the number of workers in Kansas who routed income through pass-through entities after the law passed, even though they continued to earn that income from the same source. They found more than 2,200 Kansans had done so, about 0.2 percent of workers in the state.
If the rest of the country saw the same reclassification trend as Kansas, Mr. DeBacker said, nearly 250,000 Americans would use the technique to lower their tax bills. He cautioned that the number could be larger, because the gap between the top tax rates on labor income and pass-through income would be substantially wider than it was in Kansas, and because tax professionals would have greater incentive to specialize in helping wage earners form pass-throughs.
“I’m not going to go through the hassle of reclassifying myself just to save $10,” said Joseph Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. “I’m only going to do it if there’s a payoff, and the 10 percentage points would make a difference for me.”
Mr. Rosenberg and two colleagues estimate that such shifts could reduce federal revenues by at least $41 billion a year. Most of that, $39 billion, would come from existing pass-through owners paying lower taxes. The rest would come from wealthy individuals routing income through pass-throughs to minimize taxes.
Defenders of the Kansas experiment say that the pass-through cut led to more new businesses forming, while modestly raising growth at a time when the state’s key industries — aerospace, agriculture and energy production — were faltering.
They say that the state’s budget woes came from lawmakers’ unwillingness to impose spending cuts alongside the tax cuts, and that it was never realistic to expect the tax cuts to produce enough growth to pay for themselves.
“Those are effusive political hopes — that’s not economic analysis,” said Dave Trabert, the president of the Kansas Policy Institute, a free-market think tank. “It’s pretty common for people to hope that something is going to have a tremendous, I think Governor Brownback’s phrase was, ‘shot of adrenaline.’ That’s not how economies work.”

Mr. Beaty, the Kansas football coach, was able to shield at least $575,000 a year from income taxation by routing that money through his limited liability company, according to state records. (That amount grew to $1.375 million a year in a contract extension Mr. Beaty signed in December 2016.) Next year, as a result of the recent change in state law, Mr. Beaty will face a tax liability of nearly $80,000 on his pass-through income.
Officials in the Kansas athletics department referred questions about whether tax considerations factored into Mr. Beaty’s contract structure to Mr. Beaty’s agent, Kyle Strongin, who declined to comment.
Some other prominent coaches in the state, including the Kansas men’s basketball coach, Bill Self, have long received some of their salaries through pass-through entities. Other coaches do not, including the Wichita State University men’s basketball coach Gregg Marshall, who earns $3 million a year entirely as labor income.",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/politics/kansas-tried-a-tax-plan-similar-to-trumps-it-failed.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics

"India RBI chief: growth important, but not at cost of inflation - newspaper","The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Governor Urjit Patel attends a news conference after the bi-monthly monetary policy review in Mumbai, India, October 4, 2017. REUTERS/Shailesh Andrade
MUMBAI (Reuters) - Fostering monetary conditions conducive to economic growth were a constant consideration for Indian policymakers, but would not take priority over achieving the central bank’s inflation target, Governor Urjit Patel told a newspaper on Monday.
Patel told the Mint newspaper that the economy was recovering, after growth slowed to a three-year low of 5.7 percent in the April-June quarter.
The slowdown had sparked some calls for lower interest rates, but with inflation rising the RBI left rates unchanged at a review by the monetary policy committee (MPC) last week.
“Growth is always there in the MPC’s scheme of things; we don’t lose sight of that, but not at the cost of inflation,” Patel was quoted as saying in the interview.
“However, we have to be careful — we should aim at achieving the inflation target without losing sight of supporting economic growth.”
Consumer inflation accelerated to 3.36 percent in August. India’s central bank has a medium-term target for annual inflation of 4 percent with the flexibility of plus/minus 2 percent on either side to make room for food price volatility.
The (MPC) will strive to achieve its 4 percent inflation target on a “durable basis”, Patel said.
Last week, the RBI kept its repo rate unchanged at 6.00 percent as expected last week, and raised inflation projections, cooling hopes for future rate cuts.
However, Patel said growth was already starting to recover. The RBI last week cut its projection for gross value added - an indicator of growth it prefers to 6.7 percent from 7.3 percent for the year ending in March - higher than some analyst forecasts.
“Our projections based on high frequency real economy indicators suggest that growth will pick up in the third and fourth quarters (of the current fiscal year) to above 7 percent,” he told Mint.
“We have started seeing the upturn.”
Patel has given only a handful of interviews since taking over as RBI Governor late last year.

EPA chief to sign rule on Clean Power Plan exit on Tuesday,"Scott Pruitt, Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, answers a question during the Concordia Summit in Manhattan, New York, U.S., September 19, 2017. REUTERS/Jeenah Moon - RC1A105CB430
WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Monday he would sign a proposed rule on Tuesday to begin withdrawing from the Clean Power Plan, former President Barack Obama’s centerpiece regulation to fight climate change.
“Here’s the president’s message: The war on coal is over,” EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt told a gathering in the Kentucky coal-country town of Hazard.
Green groups criticized Monday’s announcement and praised the plan, a collection of emissions standards for U.S. states that the Obama administration imposed to reduce pollution from power plants -- the largest emitters of greenhouse gases -- by 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030.
“No matter who is in the White House, the EPA is legally required to limit dangerous carbon pollution, and the Clean Power Plan is an achievable, affordable way to do that,” said Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune.
But trade organizations like the National Association of Manufacturers, which participated in a legal challenge to the plan, praised it.
“This regulation was broader than what the law allows,” said NAM Vice President Ross Eisenberg. “At the same time, we recognize the need for a policy to address greenhouse gas emissions.”
The effort to undo the plan is part of a broader target of the administration of President Donald Trump to revive the coal industry and boost domestic fossil fuels production. The EPA now says the Clean Power Plan introduced by Obama in 2015 was illegal.
Pruitt said the Obama-era plan gave the government too much influence in the competition to generate power in the United States.
Jim Matheson, chief executive of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association, an electric utility group, agreed. He said ending the plan would take pressure off some cash-strapped utilities that still relied on coal-fired power plants. But he said market forces were already moving utilities away from coal.
Total power generation by coal among the NRECA’s members fell from 71 percent in 2014 to 62 percent in 2016, Matheson said.
The EPA has not decided whether it will replace the Clean Power Plan, according to a draft of the proposal seen by Reuters on Friday, or whether or when it will propose a new rule to regulate emissions from existing power plants. But the agency said it would soon solicit information on a potential replacement.

Talks on sale of Air Berlin planes to easyJet at risk of collapse: report,"FILE PHOTO - An Air Berlin sign is seen at an Air Berlin storage hall in Berlin, Germany, August 15, 2017. REUTERS/Axel Schmidt/File Photo
BERLIN (Reuters) - Talks between the insolvent carrier Air Berlin (AB1.DE) and easyJet (EZJ.L) over the sale of up to 30 planes are at risk of falling apart, according to a report in Germany’s B.Z. newspaper on Monday.
The report, citing unnamed Air Berlin sources, said easyJet had reduced its offer of around 50 million euros ($58.69 million) for the planes.
Further complicating matters, there is disagreement over landing rights in Duesseldorf and Berlin’s Tegel airport with Lufthansa (LHAG.DE), which is bidding for other parts of Air Berlin, the report said.
Air Berlin and easyJet declined to comment.
If negotiations between the German and British carriers end with no deal, a new deal with alternative partners must be reached by the end of October because Air Berlin’s funding will dry up, the report said.
Air Berlin, which has around 8,000 employees, filed for insolvency in August after major shareholder Etihad said it would stop providing funding.
The carrier has been in talks with Lufthansa and easyJet on a carve-up of its assets such as aircraft, take-off and landing slots and crew. These talks are due to run until Oct. 12.

"U.S. President Donald Trump Quietly Signs Law To Allow Warrantless Searches In Parts Of VA, DC and MD","By Aaron Kesel
As former White House chief of staff and current Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel has said: “You never let a serious crisis go to waste.” While everyone was worried about the hurricanes, U.S. President Donald Trump signed away the Fourth Amendment buried in a new bill. He set a precedent by empowering the police state to allow warrantless searches in parts of VA, MD and D.C. near the Metro train system.
The government can now openly enter and search private property without a warrant in parts of Virginia, Maryland and D.C.
The House Joint Resolution 76 was signed into law on Tuesday, Aug. 22, by President Trump. The text is rather boring, starting off with: “Granting the consent and approval of Congress for the Commonwealth of Virginia, the State of Maryland, and the District of Columbia to enter into a compact relating to the establishment of the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission.”
CNN explained, “This law lets Virginia, Maryland and the District of Columbia form a new panel called the Washington Metrorail Safety Commission to oversee the safety of the D.C.-area public transportation Metro train system.”
The new safety commission will take over from the current Federal Transit Agency (FTA), which has been in charge of safety oversight for the Washington Metropolitan Area Interstate Compact (WMATA) since October 2015.
“We’ll set this up and get the FTA out of Metro. They are happy to get out, and we’re happy to get them out,” Metro Board of Directors Chair Jack Evans told Bloomberg BNA. “I’m glad we got this thing. If nothing else, we’ll get our money.”
However, buried within the bill’s text is a daunting “one major red flag” that would give the newly formed commission “the authority to enter property near the Metro Rail System ‘without limitation’ and without a warrant, for the purpose of ‘making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing,” The Free Thought Project reported.
The legislation reads:
In performing its duties, the Commission, through its Board or designated employees or agents, may: Enter upon the WMATA Rail System and, upon reasonable notice and a finding by the chief executive officer that a need exists, upon any lands, waters, and premises adjacent to the WMATA Rail System, including, without limitation, property owned or occupied by the federal government, for the purpose of making inspections, investigations, examinations, and testing as the Commission may deem necessary to carry out the purposes of this MSC Compact, and such entry shall not be deemed a trespass.
Only five Congressman voted against the bill according to U.S. Rep Justin Amash (R-Mich.) while three hundred ninety-nine gave their approval, and 29 didn’t bother to vote at all. Apparently, our elected officials can’t be bothered to stand up for the rights of we the people or the Constitution they swore to protect. After all, the Fourth Amendment doesn’t exist, which protects Americans from unreasonable searches and seizures or anything. As Amash pointed out, the government will now be able to kick in the doors of any private property surrounding the border of the DC Metro Rail System without needing a warrant based on any probable cause.
Only 5 of us voted against bill allowing govt to enter/search private property in parts of VA, MD & DC w/o warrant. https://t.co/SVhTWqbPaB — Justin Amash (@justinamash) July 18, 2017 FREE Stormproof, Waterproof Survival Match Kit (Ad)
A scary prospect indeed, as Rachel Blevins wrote for The Free Thought Project, “While it may only affect the Washington, D.C., metro area now, it could be laying the blueprint for future legislation across the country.”

Just Shut Up & Play Some Damn Baseball!!,"Just Shut Up & Play Some Damn Baseball!!
(Before It's News)
Look, plain and simple I am over this “Take a knee” bullshit in my opinion.
Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports
I’m not writing to debate with anyone on this. Everyone has a right to their own opinion and to protest….I get it. But I also have a right to turn on my television and watch America’s favorite pastime without the extra added political crap. It’s September and there are seven regular season games left so we have enough drama as it is. I like the drama involved in a heart racing, nail biting game between two good teams. It’s a beautiful game and an escape from reality (especially NOW) so can’t we just leave it at that?
Baseball is my first passion, football is my second. Well, it was….it was the one other sport I really enjoyed when baseball was over. I have been a fan of a poor football team for years and stood by them but at this point it’s too much political mumbo jumbo for me to actually watch a game. Suddenly football became the drama filled gossip girls crowd I worked so hard to avoid in High School. I respect your opinion whatever it may be but I want to see you PLAY THE GAME and hear about all of the news that comes form that…..not from you “taking a knee” and causing Americans everywhere to debate about whether it is right or wrong.
That is why I stopped watching. Colin Kaepernick started drama, is now UNEMPLOYED and I no longer watch football.
Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports
And now suddenly the “take a knee” fiasco finally made it into my baseball world and I admit it annoys me! Congratulations rookie kid I couldn’t care less about Bruce Maxwell of the Oakland A’s. You “took a knee” and sent a message. You are incredibly young and have much to learn in life and in baseball. You’ve had your 15 minutes of fame and brought a bunch of drama into the game I love. Now who is next? Because it is coming. The newbie opened up the flood gates.
So now that it’s out there and instead of the news main focus being about the Yankees blowing two games against the Jays and likely the division….we have to read Joe Girardi,Yankees players have no plans to protest national anthem. Really? I want to start a new movement here. There’s a cliche that says politics and religion do not belong at the dinner table. How about political protests do not belong at a baseball game?

Clearly Aaron Judge gets it. I’m sure he has a very strong opinion on this too as most of us do but at least when he was asked about it he said “You know, I’m a baseball player. My job is to focus on playing baseball right now.” It is, so thank you Judge. Even CC Sabathia had an opinion on it and he made that pretty clear on Saturday but he said his peace and left it at that. So when Sunday came around he didn’t want to revisit it and said “I don’t want to talk about that. Go to somebody else’s locker and talk about protests. Why do you have to come to me? There are 40 other guys in there” read that HERE.
We have one week left in the regular season. Maxwell said his decision “had been coming for a long time” and referenced what happened in Charlottesville. He’s had a while to sit and stew on that and just now decides to join the movement and “take a knee” right at the end of the season. I don’t look at that and find that to be “brave” or admirable at all.
There are a lot of issues in our country right now, and I am not ignoring that. We saw how high emotions ran last year in football and now it’s come into baseball. Nothing has changed for the better here, so why bring it on the field?
I just want to watch some baseball, Maxwell! I didn’t know who you were before this. I know enough about you now, but it doesn’t make me want to learn anymore.
Just play ball! There’s not a lot of it left…

Gunman’s Girlfriend Said She Didn’t Know He Planned Harm,"• The authorities found evidence that the gunman, Stephen Paddock, planned to escape after the shooting and survive, Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said at a news conference on Wednesday evening.
• The bureau is trying to reconstruct Mr. Paddock’s actions, including finding and interviewing “everyone and anyone who crossed his path in recent weeks,” Andrew G. McCabe, the deputy director of the F.B.I., said at a cybersecurity conference in Boston.
• The killer “is an individual who was not on our radar or anyone’s radar prior to the event,” Mr. McCabe said in an interview with CNBC outside the conference. “So we really have a challenging bit of detective work to do here, to kind of put the pieces back together after the fact.”
• The police on Tuesday revised the number of victims killed on Sunday to 58. All but three of the people have been identified. These are some of their stories.
• President Trump visited Las Vegas on Wednesday and offered words of support for the victims. “The message that I have is that we have a great country and we are there for you,” he said.
No links to terrorism have been found, the F.B.I. says.
Aaron Rouse, the F.B.I. special agent in charge in Las Vegas, said there was “no evidence to indicate terrorism, but this is an ongoing investigation.” Mr. Rouse said at a news conference on Wednesday evening that agents were pursuing several theories about what may have motivated Mr. Paddock.
Sheriff Lombardo seemed skeptical that Mr. Paddock moved the guns into his hotel suite by himself. More than 20 guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition were recovered in the suite. They had been brought into the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino in at least 10 suitcases, the authorities said.
“It was troublesome that he was able to move this much gear into the hotel unassisted,” the sheriff said.
A leaked photograph of the gunman’s hotel suite appears to show a piece of paper on a table. Asked about the note, the sheriff said, “It was not a suicide note.”
Law enforcement officials said on Tuesday that ammonium nitrate had been recovered from Mr. Paddock’s car at the Mandalay Bay. On Wednesday, Sheriff Lombardo said the car also contained other explosives: 50 pounds of tannerite, a nonflammable exploding target used for practice, and 1,600 rounds of ammunition.
The gunman’s girlfriend said she didn’t know he was ‘planning violence.’
“I knew Stephen Paddock as a kind, caring, quiet man. I loved him and hoped for a quiet future together with him,” Ms. Danley said in her statement. “It never occurred to me in any way whatsoever that he was planning violence against anyone.”
Ms. Danley said she was grateful to Mr. Paddock for the trip to the Philippines, her native country, to visit family, but when he wired her money, “which he said was for me to buy a house for me and my family,” she feared that it was his “way of breaking up with me.”
Ms. Danley boarded a flight from Manila to Los Angeles on Tuesday, according to Antonette Mangrobang, a spokeswoman for the Philippine Immigration Bureau.
The authorities, who met Ms. Danley at the Los Angeles airport, have called her a “person of interest” in the shooting investigation, which does not necessarily mean that she is suspected of committing a crime. She was out of the country when the shooting occurred.

More than three hours after her flight came in from Manila, an airport police officer confirmed that she had been taken out of the terminal through a side exit.
In an interview with ABC News, Reynaldo Bustos, Ms. Danley’s brother, said he had spoken with her after the shooting. He said she told him not to panic and that she had a “clean conscience.”
Ms. Danley met Mr. Paddock when she was working at a Nevada casino and he was a high-limit player, casino employees said. She worked at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa in Reno from 2010 to 2013, according to her LinkedIn account.
John Weinreich, an executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa at the time, said he believed that Ms. Danley frequently attended to Mr. Paddock, serving him food and pointing out which machines might be ripe for a payout, eventually becoming his regular host. Read more about Ms. Danley here.
The president met with victims of the attack.
Mr. Trump spent four hours in Las Vegas on Wednesday, including paying tribute to the professionalism of the doctors who treated the Las Vegas shooting victims. He said that meeting with the patients at one hospital made him “proud to be an American.”
The president said he met with some “absolutely terribly wounded” patients and hailed their bravery during the horrific attack Sunday night. He said many of those he met with were wounded as they sought to help others amid the hail of bullets from the shooter in a nearby hotel.
In brief remarks to reporters before meeting with law enforcement officials in Las Vegas, Mr. Trump said, “I think the only message I can say is that we are with you 100 percent.” Read more about his visit from our reporters.
A total of 489 people were injured in the attack, and 317 have been released from hospitals, Sheriff Lombardo said Wednesday evening.
Body camera footage captured the officers’ response.
Video
Las Vegas police officers took cover and directed concertgoers to safety as gunshots rang out on Sunday, newly released body camera footage shows.
“Hey, you guys, get down,” one officer shouted at bystanders between volleys of gunfire. “Go that way. Get out of here. There are gunshots coming from over there. Go that way.”
But some people did not believe they were under attack and rebuffed orders to evacuate. “That’s fireworks,” one bystander shouted at officers. Another yelled expletives when told to take cover.
As sirens blared and gunfire crackled, the video showed, officers strained to find the source of the shots.
“Hey, they’re shooting right at us, guys,” one officer said as he and his colleagues crouched behind a wall with their weapons drawn. “Everybody stay down, stay down.”
“North of the Mandalay Bay, it’s coming out of a window,” another officer says.
The three-minute video released by the police on Tuesday was a compilation of footage from the cameras of several officers at the scene.
“There’s multiple people shot up there,” someone says in one clip.
“We see muzzle blasts from the Mandalay Bay,” someone, apparently an officer, said in another clip.
The police have also confirmed the authenticity of leaked photographs of the deceased gunman with a revolver by his side and of his hotel suite, showing ammunition and rifles.
The gunman had stockpiled weapons.
Mr. Paddock, 64, had been buying weapons since 1982, including 33 in the past year, Jill A. Snyder, the special agent in charge of the San Francisco office of the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, told CBS on Wednesday.
Asked if such purchases would set off any alarms, she clarified that the bureau would not have been alerted. The Gun Control Act of 1968 requires sellers to report the sale or disposition of two or more handguns to the same buyer, only if those purchases occur at the same time or within five business days of each other. There is no federal law requiring sellers to alert the bureau to the sale of multiple rifles.
Twelve of the rifles Mr. Paddock had in his luxury suite on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino were outfitted with a “bump stock,” a device that enables a gun to fire like a machine gun, with hundreds of rounds per minute, which may explain how he was able to rain such devastation on the crowd below, law enforcement officials said.
Such devices are generally legal, and the possibility that he may have used them set off a fresh round of calls by Democratic lawmakers in Washington to pass more gun regulations after the tragedy.

Semiautomatic rifles, like those the gunman had, are made to fire a single round with each pull of the trigger. But recordings and witness accounts of the shooting made it clear that Mr. Paddock was firing much faster, at a rate comparable to that of a fully automatic weapon, which quickly fires round after round with a single pull of the finger. Undersheriff Kevin McMahill of the Las Vegas police said that Mr. Paddock fired on the concertgoers for nine to 11 minutes, in about a dozen bursts.
The police have found a total of 47 firearms in his two houses and the hotel suite. Ms. Snyder said on Tuesday that almost all had been traced, and that they had been bought in Nevada, Utah, California and Texas.
Mr. McCabe of the F.B.I. dismissed “dubious claims of responsibility” — a reference to statements from the Islamic State group claiming that the killer was one of its followers — and said that investigators are seeking “actual indicators of motive and intent.”
A deeper portrait of the gunman’s life is emerging.
Mr. Paddock could be imperious and demanding, expecting other people to wait on him, according to people who knew him. But his youngest brother said he was different with Ms. Danley.
“She was probably one of the only people I’ve ever seen that he’d go out of his way to do a little thing for,” said Eric Paddock, who lives in Florida. “He went out of his way to be nice to her. This is not something Steve does — go out of his way.”
The gunman was a professional gambler who routinely won and lost thousands of dollars at casinos in Reno and Las Vegas, which often provided him free rooms. “He was a math guy,” Eric Paddock said. “He could tell you off the top of his head what the odds were, down to a tenth of a percent on whatever machine he was playing.”

Stephen Paddock was the eldest of four boys who grew up angry after their father vanished from their lives, but he was the least angry of the group, said another brother, Patrick Paddock. He said that for years, their mother, who struggled to support them on her own, hid from them the fact that their father, a bank robber, had gone to prison, so they had no idea where he was.
“My brother was the most boring one in the family,” he said of Stephen. “He was the least violent one in the family, over a 30-year history, so it’s like, who?”
He said he had not spoken with his oldest brother in 20 years, but would not say why.
Stephen Paddock graduated from California State University, Northridge, a large public institution in the San Fernando Valley of Los Angeles, in 1977. Carmen Ramos Chandler, the university’s director of media relations, said that he had completed a degree in business administration.
His work history was not completely clear. Mr. Paddock worked for the federal government for roughly 10 years, from 1975 to 1985, a spokeswoman for the Office of Personnel Management confirmed.
Investigators unearthed multiple job applications, with Mr. Paddock’s fingerprints on file, as part of records reflecting his employment as a letter carrier for the Postal Service in the mid 1970s; as an Internal Revenue Service agent from 1978 to 1984; and as an auditor focused on defense contracts, a job he held until 1985. He also worked in the 1980s for one of the companies that later combined to form Lockheed Martin, the aerospace contractor.",NYTIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/las-vegas-shooting.html,0
"Marilou Danley, Gunman’s Girlfriend, Says She Was Unaware of His Plans","The statement, which was read by her lawyer, Matthew Lombard, came on the same day that a law enforcement official said she was questioned by F.B.I. agents trying to determine a motive for the deadly shooting.
It is not clear what, if anything, she knew about Mr. Paddock’s methodical plans to stockpile weapons and ferry them into a 32nd-floor hotel suite to commit mass murder.
In the statement, she said that she had no warning something so horrible was going to happen and that she would continue to pray for those who were harmed.
“I am a mother and a grandmother and my heart breaks for all who have lost loved ones,” she said.
Sheriff Joseph Lombardo of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department said Wednesday at a news conference that he thought Ms. Danley had responded as one would expect. “I think any person put in her situation would probably answer the same way,” he said, adding that he had not yet been briefed by the F.B.I. on the interview.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
During the news conference, the sheriff implied that Mr. Paddock had not left a suicide note in the room, and he said that there was evidence, which he could not discuss, that Mr. Paddock had planned to survive or escape.
After providing some details of the timeline of the shooting, Sheriff Lombardo said it was hard to believe that Mr. Paddock had done all of it by himself or that the plan could have remained a secret. Given the amount of weaponry, ammunition and electronics stashed at more than one location, he said, rhetorically, “Do you think this was all accomplished on his own?”
Steven Wolfson, the district attorney of Clark County, which includes Las Vegas, said that investigators were examining the shooting from “every angle possible, and then some.”
“We don’t know what she knew,” Mr. Wolfson said, referring to Ms. Danley, “so I think a lot more will come about in the next 48 hours.”
In her statement, Ms. Danley said she came back from the Philippines voluntarily to talk with the F.B.I. and other law enforcement officials.
Ms. Danley has not been charged with a crime, but investigators are hoping she will have insight into Mr. Paddock’s motives.
A law enforcement official said they were aware Mr. Paddock had recently wired thousands of dollars to the Philippines.
In an interview with an Australian news station, two sisters of Ms. Danley said they believed Mr. Paddock had sent her away so that he could plan the attack without her knowing.

The two sisters were interviewed anonymously, with their faces obscured. Ms. Danley’s sisters, Liza Werner and Amelia Manango, live in Australia.
They said that their sister was “madly in love” with Mr. Paddock and that she “probably was even more shocked than us” by the shooting.
“No one can put the puzzles together. No one,” one said during the interview. “Except Marilou. Because Steve is not here to talk anymore. Only Marilou can maybe help.”
Family members and former neighbors were shocked to see Ms. Danley’s name surface in connection with the shooting on news reports, as the police sought to find her hours after Mr. Paddock killed himself in his hotel room.
“She’s probably one of the most happy, outgoing, full-of-life people I’ve ever known,” said Dionne Waltrip, Ms. Danley’s former stepdaughter, who lives outside Fayetteville, Ark. “Everyone who has ever met her likes her.”
Ms. Waltrip said her father, Geary Danley, traveled the world as an auditor for FedEx and met his future wife overseas.
Ms. Danley was born in the Philippines, relatives said, and spent many years in Australia, where she became a citizen and was married to a man who later died. She also worked as a tour guide in the Philippines.
At some point, she met Mr. Danley and moved to Memphis. The couple wed in 1990 and their marriage lasted 25 years.

Ms. Danley worked retail jobs, selling mostly clothing and jewelry. Both she and Mr. Danley had children from previous relationships. Ms. Waltrip was 20 when the couple got together; Ms. Danley has a daughter who now lives in California. The couple moved to Nevada when they retired.

“They were extremely happy,” Ms. Waltrip said. “They loved each other very much.”
But before the marriage ended, Ms. Danley met Mr. Paddock. She was working at a casino and he was a high-limit player, casino employees said. She worked there from 2010 to 2013, according to her LinkedIn account.
John Weinreich, an executive casino host at the Atlantis Casino Resort Spa at the time, said he believed that Ms. Danley frequently attended to Mr. Paddock, serving him food and pointing out which machines might be ripe for a payout.
When she was around, Mr. Weinreich said, Mr. Paddock did not seem to break from his intense gambling persona at all. Eventually, Ms. Danley became his regular host.
“Then she was just gone one day,” he said. “I asked some fellow workers and they said she went off with Stephen.”
She and Mr. Danley divorced in 2015. On the divorce papers, she listed her address as a condominium in Reno owned by Mr. Paddock.
At the hilltop subdivision where the Danleys lived in Sparks, Nev., before the divorce, neighbors described Ms. Danley as a chatty extrovert who hosted cookouts and brought copious amounts of Filipino food to the semiannual block parties.
“She was always cooking,” said Christine Riley, 46, a dietitian who lived a few doors down from Ms. Danley’s former residence.

But when Ms. Danley was living with Mr. Paddock in a Reno subdivision, the couple were not viewed as sociable. “I thought maybe he was sick or something, because they were always in the house and the shades were always drawn shut,” said Susan Page, a retired financial analyst who was the couple’s next-door neighbor.
Ms. Page said she occasionally saw Mr. Paddock working on an older sport utility vehicle that seemed to be Ms. Danley’s car, and other neighbors said he had a large safe in the garage.
“They weren’t outgoing,” she said. “They didn’t participate in anything. Everybody around here, they go over to each other’s houses, they have a drink and they chitchat.”
Ms. Page added, “It wasn’t that they were unfriendly, they just didn’t socialize.”
On her own, Ms. Danley could be friendly. Connie Allred, 68, a retired dental receptionist, occasionally attended Zumba fitness classes with Ms. Danley at the subdivision’s clubhouse. She described Ms. Danley as a warm “world traveler” who went abroad several times a year and visited family in the Philippines and Los Angeles.
“She was always gone,” Ms. Allred said. “She’s a hard one to keep track of. We’d be in Zumba and then all of a sudden she would say, ‘I’m leaving for a couple months,’ and then she’d be back and then she’s traveling other places.”
Ms. Allred said she never met Mr. Paddock and Ms. Danley rarely talked about him, though she did mention his gambling habit. “She told us he was a professional gambler. She would laugh. We would tell our stories like, ‘We’ll go to the casino and I have my $20 limit,’ and she’s laughing at us, like, ‘Oh he’s in the thirty, forty, fifty, hundred thousand range.’ And I’m like, ‘Whoa!’”
Philippine immigration officials said Ms. Danley left Manila on Sept. 22 for a trip to Hong Kong and returned on Sept. 25.
Eric Paddock, Mr. Paddock’s youngest brother, said his brother loved Ms. Danley and doted on her. For her part, he said, Ms. Danley made compromises like doing without perfume, hair spray and bubble baths in order to not set off his allergies. Though his brother was a multimillionaire, he said, he did not believe she was with him because he had money.

Some people who knew Mr. Paddock said he could take on an imperious, exacting demeanor. But with Ms. Danley, he was different, Eric Paddock said.
“She was probably one of the only people I’ve ever seen that he’d go out of his way to do a little thing for,” he said. “He went out of his way to be nice to her. This is not something Steve does — go out of his way.”
He added: “Steve expected people to wait on him for the most part. But he waited on her sometimes. He would do what she wanted to do. He would defer to her in the way that he wouldn’t to the rest of humanity. Even me.”",NYTIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/us/marilou-danley-stephen-paddock.html,0

Weinstein Co board ousts Harvey Weinstein after harassment allegations,"(Reuters) - The Weinstein Co has fired co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, effective immediately, following reports of sexual harassment allegations against the executive, who was one of Hollywood’s biggest power brokers, the film production company said on Sunday.
The departure leaves Weinstein’s brother Bob, a co-chairman, and chief operating officer David Glasser at the helm of the company.
The board of directors made the decision “in light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days,” the company said in an emailed statement, adding that he had been notified.
A spokeswoman for the executive did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The company said on Friday that Weinstein, 65, was taking an indefinite leave of absence after the New York Times reported that he had made eight settlements with women who had accused him of unwanted physical contact and sexual harassment over three decades.
Weinstein has produced or distributed Oscar-winning movies including “Shakespeare in Love” and “Chicago.” He was a prominent donor to Democrats during the 2016 general election campaign.
The company also said it was conducting its own internal investigation.

Braying banshee Hillary Clinton just continues to expose her sick mind as she enters week three of the “poor, poor pitiful me” tour to promote her new book What Happened?
That Clinton belongs in the mental ward of a supermax prison has already been established but she just continues to pour it on as she rages against the man who beat her fair and square along with 63 million Americans who gave her a resounding thumbs down at the polls.
But the longer it continues, the more that it becomes apparent that the world dodged a major bullet when her ace campaign strategists decided that Rust Belt votes didn’t matter. This is NOT a person who should have ever been given access to the launch codes to the nation’s nuclear arsenal.
The latest exhibit of the workings of a deranged and bitter mind dribbled out during an interview with PBS host Charlie Rose where Mrs. Clinton compared President Trump to Vladimir Putin and suggested that Trump could order the execution of journalists.
Clinton Compares Trump to Putin: ‘Hopefully He Hasn’t Ordered the Killing of People and Journalists’ https://t.co/Prrp1mYMIM — Free Beacon (@FreeBeacon) September 26, 2017
Via the Washington Free Beacon “Clinton Compares Trump to Putin: ‘Hopefully He Hasn’t Ordered the Killing of People and Journalists’”:
Hillary Clinton said Monday on Bloomberg News that President Donald Trump has “tendencies toward authoritarianism,” adding that she hopes he has not “ordered the killing of people and journalists” as Russian President Vladimir Putin has been accused of doing. During a conversation with Charlie Rose, she compared Trump to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose relationship with Trump has particularly drawn scrutiny from Democrats and the media. Clinton discussed her ideas on Trump’s view of democracy, saying she “hopes” the president is not exactly like Putin in every way. “I don’t think he really values democracy, Charlie,” Clinton said. “He doesn’t value democracy? Rose asked. “So he’s not a ‘democrat,’ little ‘d?’” Clinton replied, “No, he’s not, he’s a top-down guy.” “He’s an authoritarian?” Rose asked. “He has tendencies toward authoritarianism,” Clinton answered. “So, he’s no different than Putin?” Rose asked. Clinton did not say Trump was different from the Russian autocrat, instead saying he “hopefully” does not commit the same crimes as Putin. “Well, hopefully he hasn’t ordered the killing of people and journalists and the like,” Clinton replied.
But of course Charlie Rose didn’t even bat an eye at this insane statement proving that Hillary’s biggest enablers are in the media.

Sharapova storms into Tianjin quarter-finals,"(Reuters) - Maria Sharapova overpowered Poland’s Magda Linette to enter the quarter-finals of the Tianjin Open on Thursday and is targeting a first title since returning from a 15-month doping ban.
The former world number one prevailed 7-5, 6-3 and will make her first quarter-finals appearance since Stuttgart in April, where she lost to Kristina Mladenovic in the next round.
Sharapova, who was beaten by Simona Halep in the third round of the China Open last week, took a 4-3 lead in the first set before Linette hit back. But Sharapova broke her rival in the 12th game to take a 1-0 lead.
Ranked 15 places below world number 71 Linette because of her absence from the tour, the 30-year-old Russian appeared in control in the next set despite conceding an early break.
The five-times grand slam champion broke back twice and held on to set up a clash with Swiss qualifier Stefanie Vogele who beat Yulia Putintseva 6-2 6-3.

Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Goalies,"Blackhawks Roster Breakdown: Goalies
(Before It's News)
With opening night less than a week away, the Blackhawks are down to some tough decisions with their roster. We talked at length about the options on Tuesday night’s Shoutcast, but there are some real questions. I’m going to break down some of the upcoming roster decisions or at least try to lay them out in a logical manor. This doesn’t mean Joel Quenneville decide to use the logical method. First, we look at my favorites, the goalies, which is the only position that is seemingly locked down.
Corey Crawford is the clear and unquestioned number one. He had has his injury bugs each year, but he is still a top 10 goalie in this league. We can all expect another injury at some point this year. It is inevitable. Crawford will continue his solid, unspectacular performance, and continue to be overlooked, as well as under rated. He won’t truly be appreciated until the Cup window is secured shut and this generation of players are retired. It is a shame that the guy gets so much angst from fans that don’t truly understand the intricacies of the position, but it is the nature of the sport and Chicago.
Sneaky offseason acquisition Anton Forsberg will back up Corey Crawford. Before camp began, I honestly thought that Jean-Francois Berube had a solid chance to challenge Forsberg for the backup job, but Berube had a pretty rusty performance against the Blue Jackets. This opened the door wide open for Forsberg. All he needs to do is be solid tonight in Detroit, and the race is officially over. Forsberg really impressed me in his opening game vs the Blue Jackets. He was big in net, quick in the crease, and composed. His reflexes are very good for a big guy. I am now aboard the Forsberg train. If he can keep this up, he’ll be a perfectly fine replacement for Scott Darling.
My dark horse this camp was Jean-Francois Berube, and he simply just didn’t deliver in his one opportunity. His first goal against was more the lack of support from his team, but he got a piece of the Ryan Murray shot. The last two goals against were pretty sloppy. There is no excuse to be giving up a goal off the end boards, from virtually behind the net, like he did to Lucas Sedlak. The third goal was a weak backhand less than a minute later by Oliver Bjorkstrand, that was actually defended alright by Brent Seabrook, which softly went 5-hole. He will be fine in Rockford, if he sneaks through waivers, and “should be” the number one guy there, but Jeff Glass is a former teammate of new coach Jeremy Colliton, so that could affect the game distribution. If Crawford or Forsberg get hurt, Berube is a fine option as well.
Jeff Glass is just a veteran depth guy that can be a leader in the locker room for the kids and provide some valuable consistent experience in the Icehogs backup role. If Glass ends up being counted on for more than a leadership role, then there are real problems.
First year pro (and Puckin Hostile favorite), Collin Delia doesn’t figure into the pro team’s plans this year, or even maybe next, but this will be an important season for him to earn a reputation and gather some crucial experience. Expect him to probably start the season in Indy, with the Fuel, and share time with Matt Tomkins. If Delia can have a solid season in Indy, we could see him get some time in Rockford as the season progresses. He has the potential and certainly has the talent. The fanboy in me wants to see Delia get some Rockford time and wow the pants off everyone, but the pragmatist in me says that isn’t realiztec to expect.
Matt Tomkins is signed to an AHL deal and will eventually end up in Indy with Delia. While I was certainly fine with Jake Hildebrand and Eric Levine in the ECHL last year, Delia and Tomkins are an upgrade to the depth of the organization. Hildebrand was just alright as the primary netminder in Indy, but was overmatched in the few times he actually saw the ice in Rockford. He today signed a tryout with the Tulsa Oilers of the ECHL. Levine was a temporary solution to the thin goaltending depth in the organization, as was Jeff Glass, and wasn’t even all that good in Indy.

"With Christian Pulisic Driving, United States Steers Closer to World Cup","When Pulisic tore open the left side of the Panama defense 11 minutes later, slotting a cross that Altidore simply poked into the net, the game — 19 minutes old — seemed over. The cherry on top — an Altidore penalty kick, on a nervy chip after Bobby Wood had been cut down on a run into the area in the 42nd minute — erased all doubt.
The day had been saved.
After Wood added a fourth in the 63rd minute, the worries, the fears of the past few days, and the past few months, were gone. It had gone so well, in fact, that United States Coach Bruce Arena could even feign the tiniest bit of disappointment afterward.
“On the night, we actually didn’t finish well,” he said. “We could have scored a lot more goals.”
Panama Coach Hernán Darío Gómez would hardly disagree. “They could have had 10 goals,” he said in declaring the Americans “immensely superior” in every way in the match, and his team’s play as “muy, muy mal” — very, very bad.
The only concern of the Americans afterward, then, was for Pulisic, who was battered several times and then, finally, so badly that he required treatment after a particularly rough foul at midfield just after halftime.

Arena, realizing Pulisic’s unique value, and the fact that he may need a similar performance to close the deal on Tuesday, had seen enough. He substituted for Pulisic a few minutes later.
“He took a few shots,” Arena said. “And so we thought it was smart to get him off the field.”
Pulisic acknowledged the beating, a fact of his life that has become common in games against Concacaf opposition, and shrugged it off. “I got kicked a few times, but I’ll be fine,” he said.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
That may or may not be the case. After answering about a dozen questions from reporters, he slipped away while teammates took their turns with the news media. Moments later, far away from the scrum, Pulisic was limping noticeably.
He had done enough, though, to nearly push his team over the qualifying line.
The decisive 90 minutes will come on Tuesday, when the United States faces Trinidad and Tobago on the road. The Soca Warriors sit last in the group, their hopes long dashed and their pride potentially bruised depending on the result of a game at the group leader Mexico later Friday night. They would seem to have little motivation at this point other than to play spoiler.
That can be an attractive bit of motivation for small Concacaf teams, however, especially when there is a chance to ding the mighty United States. The Americans know that, and they know the stakes.
And if they have learned anything on their long qualifying road — one that began with two humbling losses and the firing of their last coach, Jurgen Klinsmann — it is that nothing is certain, and that even a country accustomed to a quadrennial World Cup trip has to earn its place on the field before it can pack its bags.
“The job is half-done,” defender Matt Besler said. “Now we have to go down there and do the rest.”",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/sports/soccer/usmnt-panama-world-cup-qualifying.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fsports

CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
San Jose, CA, October 03, 2017 — CycleBar Westgate West will host Ride for Isla, a charity ride to benefit the Osteogenesis Imperfecta Foundation, on Oct. 7.
The 50-minute ride will be held at noon Saturday, Oct. 7 at CycleBar Westgate West with CycleStar instructor Pegah Olfat.
Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is a genetic bone disorder characterized by fragile bones that break easily. It is also known as “brittle bone disease.” The term literally means “bone that is imperfectly made from the beginning of life.” A person is born with this disorder and is affected throughout his or her lifetime.
Pegah is also the sponsor of the ride. Her best friend’s daughter Isla was diagnosed with Type V OI in July. There are eight types of OI and Type V is the rarest.
“Because there are fewer than 20,000 US cases per year, this disease is considered very rare,” said Olfat. “Please Ride for Isla and your donations will go to further research for Osteogensis Imperfecta!”

'Hard' Brexit seen dire for Dutch but far worse for Brits: Rabobank,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A disorderly Brexit could hit Dutch GDP twice as hard as previously estimated while decimating Britain’s economy, Rabobank said in a study published on Thursday.
Britain leaving the European Union in March 2019 without a replacement trade deal would trim as much as 4.25 percentage points off the Dutch economy by 2030, the Dutch bank estimated.
Dutch economic forecaster CPB last year calculated the loss in that scenario at up to 2 points of GDP.
In Britain, meanwhile, a hard Brexit would slash the economy by up to 18 points by the same date, Rabobank said in the 17-page study.
Given the many uncertainties still in play, banks have generally been wary of trying to quantify the impact of Brexit.
But there is a consensus that a divorce with no trade deal would spook financial markets, tarnish London’s reputation as one of the world’s top two financial centers and sow economic chaos across the region.
Rabobank estimated the loss for the Netherlands in the worst-case scenario would be 4,000 euros ($4,750) per worker by 2030, and 13,500 euros per British worker.
A “soft” Brexit incorporating trade deals would knock up to 3 percentage points off Dutch GDP, the bank said, again a less optimistic scenario than CPB’s estimate of 1.2 points.",REUTERS,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-eu-rabobank/hard-brexit-seen-dire-for-dutch-but-far-worse-for-brits-rabobank-idUSKBN1CH0XI

"Weakening Nate brings rain, tornado warnings to U.S. South","BILOXI/PASCAGOULA, Miss. (Reuters) - Hurricane Nate weakened to a tropical depression on Sunday after coming ashore in Mississippi, flooding roads and buildings but sparing the state from catastrophic damages.
Maximum sustained winds from Nate, the fourth major storm to hit the United States in less than two months, dropped to 35 miles per hour (55 km per hour) as it moved through Alabama and into Tennessee.
The remnants of the storm spawned tornado warnings in those states and the western portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. It is forecast to bring gusty winds and up to 4 inches (10 cm) of rain to parts of Ohio, Pennsylvania and New York on Monday.
The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the U.S. National Hurricane Center. Only a few hours earlier, its winds had been blowing at 70 mph (113 kph) but appeared to lack the devastating punch of its recent predecessors.
Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant told reporters there had been no deaths or reports of catastrophic damage. “We are very fortunate this morning and have been blessed,” he said.
Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the U.S. South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf.
Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.
The tropical depression’s center will move up through Alabama into Tennessee and Kentucky through Monday, the hurricane center said. Heavy rainfall and storm-surge flooding remained a danger across the region, and the hurricane center said Florida’s Panhandle and parts of Alabama and Georgia might feel tropical storm-force wind gusts.
The storm was expected to bring three to six inches of rain to parts of western North Carolina through midday Monday, with up to 10 inches possible in isolated spots. Power outages, damaged homes and roads closed by debris were all reported in the region.
Nate made its first U.S. landfall on Saturday evening near the mouth of the Mississippi River and then made a second one early on Sunday near Biloxi, Mississippi.
In Biloxi, water surged over roads during the storm and quickly receded on Sunday, leaving a boat that broke loose marooned on the beach. At a Waffle House restaurant, the storm surge deposited a dumpster in its parking lot.
Jeff Pickich, a 46-year-old wine salesman from D‘Iberville, Mississippi, was counting his blessings. Heavy winds left only minor damage, blowing down part of a fence on his rental property in Biloxi.
“I‘m just glad,” he said, digging fresh holes for fence posts. “I was afraid of the water. The water is Mother Nature. You can’t stop it.”
Water flowed through Ursula Staten’s yard in Biloxi, pushing over part of her fence and scattering debris, but did not breach her house.
“I have a mess,” the retired massage therapist said. “If we had got Irma, I would have lost everything.”

At the Golden Nugget Casino, one of eight Biloxi gaming establishments, workers rushed to clean up mud, debris and minor damage from 3 feet (1 m) of water sloshing into an entrance and the parkade. The gaming room stayed dry.
Three hundred guests remained in the hotel, some eager to try their luck after surviving Nate.
But dangers from the storm remain, with Florida Governor Rick Scott warning of tornadoes springing up in the Panhandle region and Alabama Governor Kay Ivey urging residents to prepare for strong winds and storm surges.
U.S. President Donald Trump declared federal emergencies in Alabama and Florida on Sunday, which provides additional funding for disaster relief.
Mississippi Power had restored electricity to 10,000 customers, but 4,800 were still without it. More than 1,000 people had arrived at shelters, the state Emergency Management Agency said.
Slideshow (16 Images)
Alabama Power said it had restored electricity to 58,000 of 146,000 customers who lost it.
Rainfall of 3 to 6 inches (8 to 15 cm), with a maximum of 10 inches (25 cm), was expected east of the Mississippi River in Alabama and Tennessee, the hurricane center said.
NEW ORLEANS THREAT DOWNGRADED
Forecast at one point to make landfall in Louisiana, Nate headed farther east and spared many New Orleans parishes that were devastated by Hurricane Katrina 12 years ago.
“I had prayed for this - that we would be spared,” said Amos Cormier, president of Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana’s equivalent to a county.
Bernice Barthelemy, a 70-year-old Louisiana resident, died from cardiac arrest overnight after telling Reuters on Saturday that she did not mind having to evacuate, Cormier said on Sunday. He attributed her death to the stress of the move.
New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu said he expected that evacuated residents could return home soon.
Vessel traffic and port operations at New Orleans resumed on Sunday afternoon, while the Port of Mobile in Alabama remained closed. Oil ports, producers and refiners in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama were planning reopenings as the storm moved inland on Sunday.
The storm curtailed 92 percent of daily oil production and 77 percent of daily natural gas output in the Gulf of Mexico, more than three times the amount affected by Harvey.
The storm doused Central America with heavy rains on Thursday, killing at least 16 people in Nicaragua, 10 in Costa Rica, two in Honduras and two in El Salvador.

PA Attorney General Concerned About Equifax Cyberattack; Will U.S. Attorneys General Be Upset About Utility Smart Meters Hacking?,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
 
According to news reports [1], Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro is concerned about and investigating the credit bureau Equifax’s data breach affecting some 143 to 145 million Americans.
 
“People who believe they are an identity theft victim can contact the consumer protection bureau in Shapiro’s office.” [1]
 
“New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman urged New Yorkers to look out for potential hacking and phishing attempts by cybercriminals following the Equifax data breach.” [2]
 
CNBC News reports “Massachusetts says Equifax hack exposed more than half the state to risk of fraud” [3]. Listen carefully to what Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey says in the short video in this link about hacking personal information.
 
The real problem
 
Consumers don’t know Equifax was collecting their important credit information and selling it to others! However, that’s the very same tactic/problem/issue that is being programmed to be done by and with AMI Smart Meters being retrofitted on to electric, natural gas and water utilities services nationwide by states’ utility commissions. 
 
However, no safeguards are being mandated by state public utility commissions regarding the retrieval, collection, storage, safety and personal in-home data/information collection utility companies will be exploiting via the ZigBee transmitters and local microwave networks instituted to relay personal information back to “Big Brother Utility Company,” who, in turn, will sell and profit from customers’ information!
 
As Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey correctly points out, customers don’t opt in to the data collection.
 
 
 
 
 
That also is the most important point regarding the collection of personal data from inside customers’ homes via AMI Smart Meters—customers don’t know nor opt in, which can lead to even greater risks and problems besides identity theft.
 
What are the problems?
 
The problems can be cybercriminals stalking people and/or houses to learn when homes are not occupied; learning customers’ daily routines and habits in order to burglarize or vandalize; hacking to take down a certain customer’s meter and utility service, or even an entire neighborhood of meters; plus other innovative surveillance and hacking techniques hackers will think up and implement.
 
AMI Smart Meters can be the first line of ingress into taking down the power grid in any country!
 
Selling customer data to third parties for profit
 
Customer data surveillance and utilities selling to customer-unknown third parties by utility companies across the USA and in other countries is part and parcel of the Internet of Things and the surveillance society to be instituted under the UN’s Agenda 21 and 2030 one world governance goal.
 
Where’s the proof utilities will sell customers’ data?
 
The patented algorithm “Onzo” is a ‘business hacker’ invading customers’ privacy to collect in-home data and sell it to third parties for profit and marketing leads, and who knows what else.
 
Here’s a less than 2 minute video explaining Onzo’s purpose, methodology and invasion of your privacy.
 
 
https://youtu.be/YIkT5GmoIgQ?
 
About ONZO
 
ONZO is a global leader in consumer energy data and analytics. ONZO combines the science of energy analytics with disaggregation, lifestyle behavior analysis and probabilistic forecasting to give utilities and their customers unprecedented insights into how, where and when energy is used. Leveraging granular smart meter date, ONZO’s patented algorithms result in rich, highly accurate, customer-specific insights with actionable outcomes that help utilities improve customer engagement and energy efficiency, while reducing churn and creating new revenue opportunities.

Besides all of the above, costumers’ collected information will travel over highly porous microwave frequencies—similar to cell phone calls—and they can be hacked into by any high school kid with some knowledge of computers and a penchant for cyber thrills. What about the Russians?
 
Why should consumers be concerned?
 
First and foremost, probably nine out of ten utility customers don’t know they have had an AMI Smart Meter retrofitted on to their electric, natural gas and water utility services.
 
Secondly, customers are not aware that those new meters are sophisticated computers that will have to be replaced every 5 to 6 years and customers will be billed for them, as they are now, via monthly installments to their utility bills while utility companies obtained federal grants in the millions to roll out AMI Smart Meters!
 
Moreover, customers do not know their private lives are/will be monitored 24/7/365 to the point of knowing when you shower; use certain electrical devices no matter how personal; have that information sold to unknown third parties for unknown reasons and consequences; open your privacy and home to becoming a target for thieves, burglars and cybercriminals.
 
Safety or surveillance?
 
The New World Order governance agenda under the United Nations utilizing all the new “smart” technologies we’ve become addicted to, only leaves everyone more vulnerable to become a sitting duck for more and more criminal activity at the personal level. Do you want that?
 
Now is time during the Equifax fiasco about privacy and personal information being compromised to contact your respective state’s public utility commission and attorney general to bring the above information about AMI Smart Meter privacy issues to their attention and demand safety and security for your personal information, plus whatever else you don’t like or fear about AMI Smart Meter surveillance.
 
The analog meter, which operated without problems for decades while not spying on your house, is the safest meter to have. It’s not a fire hazard, as AMI Smart Meters are, because AMI SMs are made with plastic parts, have no surge protectors and emit non-thermal radiation waves that cause adverse health issues.
 
 
American Natural Superfood - Free Sample (Ad)
 
With AMI Smart Meters, customers can lose their privacy; become sitting ducks for criminals; and also lose their health due to electromagnetic hypersensitivity (EHS) or what the medical profession calls idiopathic electromagnetic intolerance (IEI).

Melania Trump responds to Ivana Trump calling herself 'first lady',"(CNN) President Donald Trump's first wife, Ivana Trump, called herself ""first lady"" in an interview Monday ahead of the release of her memoir, ""Raising Trump."" Now his current wife, first lady Melania Trump, is firing back, slamming her comments as ""attention-seeking and self-serving noise.""
Trump boasted of having the ""direct number"" to her ex-husband at the White House, telling ABC News she talks to the President about once every 14 days.
""I have the direct number to White House but I don't really want to call him there because Melania is there and I don't really want to cause any kind of jealousy or something like that because I'm basically first Trump wife, OK? I'm first lady, OK?"" she told ABC, laughing.
The current and only first lady fired back via a sharply-worded statement to CNN from her communications director, Stephanie Grisham.
""Mrs. Trump has made the White House a home for Barron and the President. She loves living in Washington, DC, and is honored by her role as first lady of the United States. She plans to use her title and role to help children, not sell books,"" Grisham said, adding, ""There is clearly no substance to this statement from an ex, this is unfortunately only attention-seeking and self-serving noise.""
The statement is a stunning departure for Melania Trump, who, until Monday, had largely stayed above the fray, isolating herself from negativity and critics.
She has refrained from wading into news-of-day debates and controversy, focusing on son Barron, 11, and working to develop her platform as first lady. When her husband's ex-wife's book comes out on Tuesday, she will be traveling to West Virginia, where she will visit with infants affected by opioid addiction.
Though the first lady has previously said she has a ""thick skin"" and isn't bothered by criticism, it is clear that Ivana Trump's comments struck a nerve.
Ivana and Donald couple divorced in 1992 following his tabloid affair with Marla Maples.
Ivana Trump, who is the mother of the President's three eldest children, Donald Jr., Ivanka, and Eric, does not refer to the President's second wife, Marla Maples, by name in the new book, which comes out Tuesday, only calling her ""showgirl.""
""Donald during the divorce was brutal. He took the divorce as a business deal and he cannot lose, he has to win,"" Trump said, adding that they are now ""friends.""
Daughter Ivanka Trump has said her parents take a similar ""all out"" approach to life. Her mother's comments to ABC reflect a similar -- if provocative -- tact to the unfiltered rhetoric that made Trump's candidacy successful.
""My mother is an exuberant woman, filled with a passion for life and adventure that made it hard for her to stay in one place for long,"" daughter Ivanka Trump wrote in her 2009 book, ""The Trump Card."" ""My parents are strikingly similar in that regard. They've grown apart, and even when they were together they seemed to be cut in different ways, but they do share an approach to life: all out, all the time.""
Trump also weighed in on a number of hot-button issues during the interview.
She said she had ""zero concerns"" about Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, including as it pertains to her eldest son, Don Jr., who has been called to testify.
""I know that he was not involved at all in any wrongdoing,"" she said.
She declined to talk about the 2005 ""Access Hollywood"" tape , saying, ""I don't want to go into it."" Asked whether she ever talked to the President about it, she said, ""Not really, no.""
Trump, who was raised in Czechoslovakia, also discussed immigration.
""I'm (an) immigrant myself and Donald is building the wall. I don't mind immigrants and the wall because you have to protect your borders,"" she said.
Pressed on whether she agreed with the President's policy on ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, she said, ""I really don't know, I would not send (away) probably thousands and thousands of kids which were born here. But it's very political and very confusing. So I really don't have an answer on that.""
Trump, who claims ""full credit"" for raising her three children with the then-businessman in her book, also said her ex-husband was a ""loving father"" but was not involved in their day-to-day upbringing.
""Donald was on the telephone making the deals,"" she said. ""He was loving father, don't get me wrong. And he was a good provider. But he was not a father which would take a stroll and go to Central Park or go play baseball with them. It was only until they were about 18 years old he could communicate with them, because he could talk business with them.""

Trump Administration Formally Lifts Sanctions on Sudan,"But she added, “Any further normalization of ties will require continued progress by the government of Sudan.”
Left unanswered by diplomats was why the rapprochement with Sudan was deemed worthy of continuing while similar détentes with Iran and Cuba have been either excoriated or partly reversed. State Department officials who on Friday briefed reporters on the Sudan policy said their expertise did not extend beyond Africa so they could not answer questions on Iran or Cuba.
The difference with Sudan may be that President Trump and Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson have demonstrated little interest in Africa, allowing lower-level diplomats to push forward with a policy they and many academics support.
“Punishing an awful government may be justified and morally satisfying, but for two decades it hasn’t done much good,” said Zach Vertin, who helped forge the new Sudan policy during the Obama administration. “This policy is an attempt to chart a smarter, more nuanced approach.”

Trump administration officials asked the Sudanese government to stop buying weapons from North Korea, a request that was not part of the agreement with Khartoum as negotiated with the Obama administration. Even so, State Department officials emphasized that the North Korean issue would not have been a deal breaker since, as they said, it was important that the United States abide by previous commitments.
Sudan remains on a list of countries that are considered sponsors of terror, and a separate review is underway to determine whether it should be removed from that list, as Khartoum is eager to see. The terror designation means that restrictions remain on foreign assistance and defense sales. Sanctions specifically related to the conflict in Darfur also remain in place.
The sanctions, which had been under suspension and will be lifted permanently as of Oct. 12, include a trade embargo and the blocking of assets held by the Sudanese government that were put in place by executive order in 1997 and 2006. The hope is that by lifting the sanctions permanently, businesses will have the confidence to invest in Sudan, where infrastructure and other needs are acute.
Ibrahim Ghandour, the Sudanese foreign minister, said that “lifting the sanctions means lifting the extortion from the people of Sudan who long suffered from them.”

But Stuart Newberger, a Washington attorney who represents a dozen Americans killed in a 1998 truck bombing against the American Embassy in Nairobi, Kenya, said the Trump administration should have secured a commitment that the Sudanese government would pay billions of dollars in court judgments from lawsuits filed by the victims of that attack and another in Tanzania. The victims claimed that Sudan provided support to the attackers, who were members of Al Qaeda; the attacks elevated Osama bin Laden to the F.B.I.’s Most Wanted list for the first time.
“The Trump administration has today not said a word about the judgments against Sudan,” Mr. Newberger said.

Mexico plans aid for Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria,"Sneakers hang from downed wires in the wake of Hurricane Maria in the Vietnam section of Guaynabo, Puerto Rico on October 1, 2017. REUTERS/Nick Brown
MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Suffering itself after two major earthquakes last month, Mexico plans to send aid including water and electricity experts to Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory reeling from the devastation of Hurricane Maria.
The gesture, announced by the Mexican government on Wednesday, follows an awkward series of exchanges between Mexico and the United States over emergency aid in recent weeks.
Mexico plans to send some 30 tons of bottled water, mosquito repellent and specialists in power generation, transmission and distribution from the state power utility, Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
The Federal Electricity Commission (CFE) team would work to mitigate the damage and assist in restoring power supply after Maria, the ministry said.
The strongest hurricane to hit Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, Maria caused at least 34 deaths and inflicted widespread damage to homes and infrastructure, including wiping out power across the Caribbean island.
Mexico has had strained relations with its northern neighbor since U.S. President Donald Trump took office in January, promising to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out illegal immigrants and drugs.
Mexico had planned to send material assistance to the United States after Hurricane Harvey, which hit Texas in late August, but later withdrew the offer after the first of the two quakes struck southern Mexico in early September.
Trump was criticized in Mexico for the time he took to offer condolences to his Mexican counterpart, Enrique Pena Nieto, over the first quake, which killed at least 98 people. The U.S. president later said he had been unable to reach Pena Nieto because of poor cellphone reception.
Ironically, after Maria struck Puerto Rico, the local cellphone operator of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim proved more reliable than some U.S. competitors during the early days of the communications outage across the island of 3.4 million people.",REUTERS,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-puertorico-mexico/mexico-plans-aid-for-puerto-rico-after-hurricane-maria-idUSKBN1C925G

Five arrested in Delhi over assault on Nigerian,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption African students often complain that they are racially abused in India
Police in the Indian capital Delhi have arrested five people after a video circulated showing what appears to be a mob severely beating a Nigerian man.
They have also detained the Nigerian, whom some residents accused of theft.
The video shows four or five men using sticks to beat a man of African appearance who has been tied to a post.
There was a spate of attacks on African nationals living in India last year, including one in which a Congolese man was beaten to death in Delhi.
Police said the latest incident happened on 24 September, and the Nigerian victim was also arrested due to a theft allegation.
A resident of the Savitri Nagar neighbourhood claimed the man broke into his house and tried to steal valuables from his room, police said.
""It is a case of attempted burglary. Those living in the house got alerted. They caught him and beat him up,"" Dependra Pathak, chief spokesperson of the Delhi Police told the Press Trust of India news agency.
In March, five Nigerian students were attacked by crowds, while another was beaten by a mob inside a shopping mall living in Noida, near Delhi.
Six months ago, African ambassadors in India criticised the government for not doing enough to stop a string of alleged racist attacks on Africans in Delhi.",BBC,"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-41578210

Google Clips Automatically Identifies Everyone Including Your Pets,"By MassPrivateI
Are you looking forward to the holiday season?
Do you want the latest in corporate advertised surveillance?
Then hurry up and be the first one in your family to purchase a $249.00 Google Clips camera that automatically identifies you and your pets.
Clips automatically chooses which moments to capture and keep, so you don’t need to be behind the camera. (Source)
Because nothing says Big Brother like a camera that automatically identifies everyone it takes pictures of.
Google uses facial recognition to spy on you and your pets
The Google store warns that Clips can recognize familiar faces and pets…
Google Clips is smart enough to recognize great expressions, lighting and framing. So the camera captures beautiful, spontaneous images. And it gets smarter over time. Google Clips learns to recognize familiar faces. The more you’re with someone, the more it learns to capture clips of them. It can also pick out pets like cats or dogs. (Source)
How can Clips recognize you and your pets?
For years, Google has warned people that they use pattern and facial recognition to identify everyone. But Clips takes it a step further and uses machine-learning technology to identify everyone. (Click here to find out more about Google’s facial recognition.)
Google claims Clips was designed with privacy safeguards…
We know privacy and control really matter, so we’ve been thoughtful about this for Clips users, their families, and friends. (Source)
How thoughtful has Google been? And why should anyone worry about privacy if Clips isn’t connected to the Internet?
Updated 10/9:
Google uses facial recognition to identify everyone twice
According to an article in Computerworld, Clips uses embedded facial recognition to identify people once and then uses Google Photos facial recognition to identify people a second time!
And here’s the revolution: The face recognition takes place on the device, not in the cloud. Pictures are stored on the device, not in the cloud. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) Of course, you can use the app to choose clips for uploading to Google Photos. Once uploaded into Google Photos, the pictures will be processed again for face recognition, and this time with names attached… (Source)
Google Photos can reproduce or modify your pictures
Google Clips tells users to download their pictures to Google Photos, which gives Google permission to modify your pictures, make compilation videos of them and much more.
Once a user has downloaded their pictures to Google Photos, they can kiss their privacy goodbye as their Terms of Service states.
When you upload, submit, store, send or receive content to or through our Services, you give Google (and those we work with) a worldwide license to use, host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works… (Source)
Business Insider warns that Google can recognize people’s faces taken years apart and identify the brand of clothing you’re wearing. An article in Newsend warns that Google Photos is creating a valuable profile of every user for advertising purposes.
If you’re concerned about your privacy, buy a digital camera that lets you to upload your pictures to your laptop without a corporation spying on you.

"A ""problem"" For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez...","A “problem” For The Wild Card Game & Sanchez…
(Before It's News)
(Sept. 13, 2017 – Source: Abbie Parr/Getty Images North America)
The media is looking for someone to blame for Thursday night’s loss to the Rays and they seem to have found it. It was days ago, and as the Yankees look toward their make it or break it game against the Twins on Tuesday the rumors are still out there. Fair or not, Gary Sanchez looks to be the scapegoat and some don’t want him behind the plate on Tuesday.
Sanchez has been scrutinized a lot this season for his defense and now suddenly when the Yankees need to focus on putting the best lineup on the field Tuesday there is growing support around media that Austin Romine should be the starting catcher that night. I like Romine, but do I want him catching and taking a DH spot away from another big hitter?
Photo Credit: Kathleen Malone-Van Dyke
A wild pitch and a low ball that should have been caught but instead scooted underneath Sanchez’s glove are causing a lot of doubt in people’s minds. Both Newsday and the NY Daily News are rallying for Romine behind the plate and Sanchez as the DH.
Do I have confidence in Romine defensively? Sure, but I don’t have a lack of confidence in Sanchez either. No offense to Romine, he’s not the same hitter as some of the other guys on the team. Using him in this game means losing a more powerful bat which I am not confident in with a one game playoff spot.
Sanchez is a young kid. He’s had some mistakes and we’ve seen that but we have lived with his defensive blips all season long and still managed to get to the playoffs. I don’t think this is the time to be taking certain guys out of their element and putting them into a position they haven’t been playing consistently all season. Sanchez has a groove and maybe putting him at DH here isn’t the best way to tinker with the lineup here. Experimenting in a one chance game could be a costly mistake.
(Brad Penner/USA Today Sports)
I really want the best bats in the lineup. We have our best pitcher going and we need the best possible offense too so I don’t want to think about who has to sit out just so we can give our backup catcher a night to play. Who do you have sitting on the bench? Aaron Hicks? Todd Frazier? Matt Holliday? It doesn’t add up for me. We’ve had nothing but success so far against the Twins in the playoffs but now is not the time to sleep on them. This isn’t a guaranteed win and we need the best guys on the field.
Sanchez has been one of our best guys all season even with those mistakes. He’s earned his spot, and I know he is going to come out fighting that day. He’s hungry for this game just like the rest of our guys and all fans. I think the media is going a little overboard here. It’s do or die time and I am riding with my everyday catcher here so I hope Joe Girardi does too.

Upgrading to a Modern Mac,"Q. I’m about to purchase an iMac desktop computer. Are they as good as the old ones? I have an old MacBook on which I use AppleWorks. Will a new Mac convert it to a current word-processing program?
A. Apple regularly updates its computers with faster processors, sharper screens and slicker software, so buying a new iMac gets you a machine that’s technically better than an older model. However, you may have an adjustment period with the new hardware and the new operating system if you have not upgraded in several years. The Migration Assistant program included with new Macs can also help you move your files from the old machine to the new one, but older software may not run on a modern Mac.
The old AppleWorks collection of office and art programs was officially retired more than 10 years ago, replaced by Apple’s iWork suite. That software has evolved into three free programs (a word processor called Pages, spreadsheet software called Numbers and the Keynote presentation application) that work on Macs, on iOS devices and within a web browser. You get the current version of the programs on your new Mac when you buy it, but depending on the version of AppleWorks you were using, you may have some trouble opening the older files with the new software.

If you were using AppleWorks 6 and saved all your files in that version of the program, you can try to open them with the current iWork programs, but files in AppleWorks 5 or earlier are not compatible. Just double-clicking on an AppleWorks document icon from files you have copied over probably will not work, but try opening the Pages program first, then going to the File menu to Open and selecting an AppleWorks file (or an older iWork file) in the window to see if it cooperates and opens. If it does, choose Save As from the File menu to save the old document in the newer Pages format.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Numbers and Keynote programs may be able to open AppleWorks spreadsheets and presentations the same way. If the files will not open, you may be able to convert them to newer formats by opening them within the open-source LibreOffice suite, which has a good reputation for cracking open files in outdated formats.

You can also check the Mac App Store or around the web for a text-utility program that can extract the words from the file from the garbled formatting code. The TextEdit app, which comes with your Mac, may be able to open the file so you can copy the content into a Pages file.
If the older computer and version of AppleWorks you have been using are still operational, you could also prepare your files for transfer ahead of time and export them right from AppleWorks into more flexible formats that newer programs can easily open. With AppleWorks 6 word-processing documents, for example, you can save them as plain text, HTML files, rich-text format (.rtf) files or Microsoft Word files.",NYTIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/05/technology/personaltech/upgrading-to-a-modern-mac.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpersonaltech,0

It was an uncomfortable scene on Wednesday during the media session with Panthers quarterback Cam Newton, as female reporter Jourdan Rodrigue asked Newton about receivers running routes, and Newton basically laughed her off.

Rodrigue went up to Newton and asked him about the sexist remark one-on-one, and according to the reporter, Newton didn’t give a very good answer, and in her words the answer was no acceptable.
“I spoke with him after and it was worse. I chose not to share, because I have an actual job to do today and one he will not keep me from.”
It’s amazing that Newton would go that route, and even more so that he wouldn’t say ‘sorry’ to Rodrigue after the remark. We shall see the fallout about this latest comment.

The Las Vegas Police Department on Friday released a video that would appear to debunk NFL national anthem protest ringleader Michael Bennett’s claim that he was racially profiled during an arrest in August. Bennett was in Sin City attending the Mayweather-McGregor title bout and afterward, went to a club where what a call to investigate a possible shooting resulted in police being sent to the scene. Upon their arrival, the Seattle Seahawks $31.5 million defensive lineman and social justice activist was deemed to be acting suspiciously – hiding behind a machine and taking flight – which resulted in him being briefly detained by officers. Bennett claimed that a gun was held to his head and that he was in fear for his life (no video to either confirm or rebut this exists) and that the police used excessive force and that he was the victim of racial profiling. The second accusation was nonsense because there were many blacks at the club at the time of the call although they weren’t acting in a manner that attracted the attention of officers. Sheriff Joe Lombardo defended his officers and rebutted claims of the racial profiling, another video showed that despite his claims, …

World Cup 2018: What are England boss Gareth Southgate's big challenges?,"Southgate has won six of his 11 matches as England manager, losing twice
Gareth Southgate successfully completed phase one of his task since succeeding Sam Allardyce as England manager by qualifying for the 2018 World Cup.
England secured their place in Russia with a 1-0 victory over Slovenia at Wembley on Thursday, but it was a struggling, spluttering performance that only underlined the scale of the task facing Southgate if he is to end an almost unbroken tale of under-achievement at recent major tournaments.
Fabio Capello's England were thrashed 4-1 by Germany in the last 16 at the World Cup in South Africa in 2010 and his successor, Roy Hodgson, could not get England out of the group stage in Brazil four years later.
Hodgson lost to Italy on penalties in the last eight of Euro 2012 before the embarrassment of a last-16 defeat by Iceland at Euro 2016 was the catalyst for his resignation.
There was little fanfare, celebration or sense of expectation around a discontented Wembley as England limped over the finishing line on Thursday - only evidence that Southgate has a huge job to get his squad in shape for next summer.
So what are the big issues facing 47-year-old Southgate, who was officially placed in charge in November 2016 after Allardyce's 67-day reign, as he plans to end England's cycle of failure?
Stick with Hart in goal?
Joe Hart was at fault for one of Iceland's goals at Euro 2016
Joe Hart has been unchallenged as England's first-choice tournament keeper since Euro 2012 in Poland and Ukraine, but the 30-year-old is now facing the twin obstacles of declining form and increased competition.
Hart made crucial errors and had technical flaws exposed when conceding long-range goals to Gareth Bale against Wales and Iceland's decisive goal from Kolbeinn Sigthorsson - both low and to his left from distance - at Euro 2016 and endured a mixed spell on loan at Torino when Pep Guardiola decided he was not his man at Manchester City.
Now at West Ham, Hart came under further scrutiny when conceding free-kicks to Leigh Griffiths in the 2-2 draw with Scotland at Hampden Park in June.
Southgate surprised many with his staunch faith in Hart, who made his international debut in June 2008, when retaining him for qualifiers in Malta and at home to Slovakia, although he made an important double save before Harry Kane's late winner against Slovenia at Wembley on Thursday.
However, the return to form and fitness of Stoke's Jack Butland - out for more than a year after injuring an ankle playing for England in Germany - means the goalkeeping debate will continue.
With Jordan Pickford, who is only 23, a rare shaft of light in Everton's desperate start to the season after his £30m move from Sunderland, the debate is likely to be pored over on a weekly basis as England keep faith with Hart but also have the best back-up options they have enjoyed for years.
Southgate may be taking a history lesson when it comes to England changing keepers after the failed introduction of Scott Carson for the key Euro 2008 qualifier at home to Croatia and Rob Green's blunder that gave the United States a draw in the opening game of the 2010 World Cup.
Southgate's goalkeeping options Since start of 2016-17 (league) Joe Hart Jack Butland Fraser Forster Tom Heaton* Jordan Pickford *Heaton is currently injured Games played 44 12 45 39 36 Goals conceded 75 19 55 52 62 Saves made 119 37 100 149 156 Clean sheets 9 3 17 10 5 Errors leading to goals 5 0 2 0 3 Save % 61% 65% 64% 74% 72%
Former England pair Phil Neville and Chris Waddle believe Southgate has made the correct decision in sticking with Hart.
Neville tells BBC Sport: ""Patience is the key and Gareth has got it absolutely right. If the first World Cup game was next week Joe Hart would be my number one.
""He'll want to protect his young goalkeepers. Pickford has got a lot on his plate to establish himself and have a full season at Everton. He's moved for a big price tag.
""Butland is only 24 and was out for a very long time with injury last year. It is a big season in terms of fitness. Can he play a full season? Has he got the durability?""
Waddle says: ""Joe is in the driving seat unless he makes a couple of big mistakes.
""There are certain positions in the team where you need settled partnerships. You need your goalkeeper to know his back four well and his centre-halves. It is a problem when you are throwing people in before or during a tournament.""
Former England defender Terry Butcher, who believes it is time for change, says: ""If you have got someone with Jack Butland's presence behind you it gives even more confidence, but with Joe there have been mistakes.
""Joe has done very well for England but his time has come to an end now.""
Southgate's instincts, for now at least, tell him to stick with Hart.
Can the centre of defence take the strain?
In the 12 matches since Euro 2016 England have started with six different centre-back combinations. The regular pairing has been Gary Cahill and John Stones (six matches). Cahill has started 11 out of 12 games.
England's changing central defensive partnerships have always survived in relative comfort in qualifiers only to be picked apart in the heat of tournament combat.
Gary Cahill and Phil Jagielka were exposed by Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani in defeat by Uruguay in Brazil in 2014, while Chelsea's captain and Chris Smalling fared no better in France two years later.
Will it be any different in Russia?
Southgate still has shuffling to do in this position, but some pointers are emerging that might signpost the way to his partnership next summer.
Cahill and Manchester United's rejuvenated Phil Jones have started to establish a partnership. although a glance towards Manchester City may offer an even more attractive option.
John Stones disappeared almost unnoticed from England's team after being heralded as the future of their defence following a £47.5m move from Everton to Manchester City in summer 2016. He is now showing the sort of form that might tempt Southgate once more.
Neville says: ""If we are going into a major tournament in six or seven months' time and John Stones isn't our number one centre-back then he is not fulfilling his potential.
""In the World Cup, John Stones has got to be our number one centre-back. That is if he performs - he has to produce the qualities we know he has got and if he does he will start as number one centre-back probably alongside Phil Jones.""
Phil Neville's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
Waddle, however, has an interesting twist and potential for left-field experimentation. He says: ""Have we got the quality of defenders to cope with the top sides? At the minute it is a concern.
""I'd like to see Kyle Walker play a game in central defence. He's quick. He's strong. He's good in the air and he's got unbelievable energy.
""A lot of people say you'll miss him on the flank but you've still got people like Nathaniel Clyne when he hopefully gets fit again at Liverpool and Kieran Trippier at Spurs.
""It would be really interesting if you put Stones, Walker and another in there as an experiment.
""You could play Stones, Walker and Eric Dier. Decent on the ball, mobility, and you have Walker's raw pace as well.""
Chris Waddle's England starting XI at the 2018 World Cup
Will lack of midfield creativity dent England's chances?
England's central midfield combinations are workmanlike but lack players in the mould of Steven Gerrard, Frank Lampard and Paul Scholes - the pass master who can make a difference.
It will prove a serious handicap in Russia if England struggle to serve the most potent part of their team, with Harry Kane up front and Dele Alli in behind.
It is not helped by a lack of contenders to play the role of finding the key to unlocking opposition defences.
""The biggest talking point in Southgate's team is in central midfield,"" says Neville.
""It is crying out for a creative player. Could it be Jordan Henderson, Eric Dier and Adam Lallana when he's fit? There is a space in midfield. There is a position on the right-hand side and in central midfield.""
Steven Gerrard was the last England player to score more than once at a World Cup with two goals in 2006
England's central midfield will be resolute in Russia, but where is the inspiration and creation?
""Sometimes you need someone with a variation of pass. England have players who can get it and give it,"" says Waddle.
""I don't think people like Jordan Henderson have played badly but sometimes you need someone who can get the ball off the back three or four and can just turn and see someone 40 or 50 yards away.
""The only two who come to mind at the minute who hit that sort of pass are Danny Drinkwater and Jonjo Shelvey. Henderson is very good at linking the play with simple football, as are Dier and Jake Livermore. Lallana is give-and-go, not a 30- or 40-yard passer.
""I know what people can say: Drinkwater might not get in Chelsea's team and Shelvey can let himself down but they can hit those passes.
""People like Shelvey and Drinkwater are maybe not everyone's cup of tea but you have to look at a system and balance. You shouldn't just pick the best English players at the top clubs.""
Shelvey has created the most chances of England's midfield contenders since the start of last season, although he was playing in the Championship for Newcastle in 2016-17.
Who are England's World Cup match-winners?
England have a striker close to world class in Harry Kane - and there are reasons for optimism if Southgate can find a way to serve a potentially deadly attack.
Dele Alli has proved his quality, if not his temperament, for Spurs and England, while Manchester United's Marcus Rashford looks increasingly like a certain starter in Russia.
Where are the goals coming from? Since Gary Lineker scored 10 goals in two World Cups (1986, 1990) no England player has scored more than twice at the tournament The current England squad has scored 60 goals between them. Harry Kane and Jermain Defoe are responsible for 31 of those
So are there reasons for England to be cheerful heading into the 2018 World Cup after the trauma of recent major tournaments?
The Kane-Alli axis will carry England's threat, according to Waddle. ""Kane just doesn't seem to miss. He is in the right position every time and you can't coach that,"" he says.
""You have to play Dele Alli with him. Now we have to look at how to get the best out of those players and build a team around them.
""Alli is a cert. He plays with Kane week in and week out. He makes a lot of his goals for him and they have a great partnership.""
England's World Cup wins 2014: None 2010: Slovenia (1-0) 2006: Paraguay (1-0), Trinidad & Tobago (2-0), Ecuador (1-0) 2002: Argentina (1-0), Denmark (3-0) 1998: Tunisia (2-0), Colombia (2-0)
Phil Neville looks towards his former home of Old Trafford for the forward Southgate should integrate alongside Kane and Alli.
""Fast forward seven months and you have got to be saying Rashford should be in there"", says Neville.
""If Gareth can find a system for both Rashford and Kane then that would be as exciting a partnership as most teams could offer going forward.
""Kane is at that level now where he is becoming a world-class centre-forward and Rashford has got the potential to be there if he keeps developing.
""Rashford is going to be a superstar - I've said it a million times; I really believe that. You can see him, Kane and Dele Alli producing.""
If Southgate can use England's forthcoming friendlies to forge a link between that trio, he and his squad can carry serious danger in Russia next summer.
Should Kane be England's World Cup captain?
Outsiders - even then England manager Fabio Capello - never understand the nation's obsession with who leads the team out.
However, it still matters and it seems Southgate has narrowed it down to a choice between Kane and Henderson, who have both had auditions during the World Cup qualifiers.
Harry Kane has scored 11 goals for England, including six in his past five appearances
Kane captained the team against Slovakia. He has the advantage of being a certain starter, a goalscoring inspiration and a role model on and off the field, while Henderson may need to fight for his place.
Neville is certain who it should not be. He says: ""I've never been a fan of centre-forwards being captain - they are under enough pressure to score goals as it is. I would just say to Harry Kane, 'You just concentrate on scoring goals.'
""I'd give it someone like Jordan Henderson, or Eric Dier could be a real outside chance if he cements his place in the team.""
Butcher has a different view. ""There is only one person for me and that is the person who is going to play on a regular basis and that is Harry Kane,"" he says. ""He is the poster boy but he is also producing the goods.
""He is one of the first, if not the first, name on the team sheet. You couldn't say that about Jordan Henderson.
""You can't argue with Kane's record or the way he goes about his work. He is a lethal striker but an absolute gentleman off the pitch.""",BBC,"http://www.bbc.com/sport/football/41503064

"Iran hardliners, pragmatists show unity in response to Trump","LONDON (Reuters) - A tough line from President Donald Trump has been met by a show of unity from both sides of Iran’s political divide, uniting hardliners who cast the United States as an implacable enemy with pragmatists who seek rapprochement with the West.
Iran, which has kept up a steady drumbeat of angry statements for days, lashed out again on Tuesday, threatening to teach the Americans “new lessons” and keep “all options on the table” if Washington blacklists its Revolutionary Guards.
Trump, who has accused his predecessor Barack Obama of being too soft on Iran, is expected to announce a hardening of policy this week, likely to include “decertifying” a landmark 2015 deal that lifted international sanctions in return for curbs on Tehran’s nuclear programme. Such a step would stop short of pulling out of the agreement, leaving that decision to Congress.
Trump is also expected to designate Iran’s most powerful security force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), as a terrorist organisation. The IRGC has a vast economic empire in Iran, and blacklisting it could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to access the global financial system.
“It seems the Trump administration understands only swear words, and needs some shocks to understand the new meaning of power in the world,” said Iranian armed forces spokesman Masoud Jazayeri, who is also a Revolutionary Guards commander.
“The Americans have driven the world crazy by their behaviour. It is time to teach them a new lesson.”
Several Iranian newspapers ran the same photo on the front page on Tuesday: the urbane, U.S.-educated Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif laughing and hugging the commander of the IRGC, Major-General Mohammad Ali Jafari, in a striking display of unity between the two main factions of Iran’s leadership.
“We have a similar stance but different ways of saying it,” the papers quoted Jafari as saying.

Iran’s moderate president Hassan Rouhani won re-election less than five months ago after a campaign in which he called for better ties with the outside world and reform at home, openly criticising the influence of the IRGC which he accused of backing his hardline opponent. But the moderates and hardliners tend to rally together in public when threatened from abroad.
“The Americans are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards,” Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by ISNA. “We have all options on the table. Whatever they do, we will take reciprocal measures.”
U.S. sanctions on the IRGC could affect conflicts in Iraq and Syria, where Tehran and Washington both support warring parties that oppose the Islamic State militant group (IS).
Russia, Iran’s ally that is also fighting IS in Iraq and Syria, said on Tuesday that it does not consider the Revolutionary Guards to be a terrorist organisation.

“FIRM, DECISIVE AND CRUSHING”
The Iranian nuclear deal, backed by European countries, China and Russia, lifted broad international sanctions over Iran’s nuclear programme that had been tightened during the Obama years and had caused severe damage to Iran’s economy.
But Washington still maintains separate unilateral sanctions over Tehran’s ballistic missile programme and over allegations that it supports terrorism. The lingering U.S. sanctions have slowed Iran’s re-emergence into the world economy, making global banks reluctant to take on business with Iranian firms despite the nuclear deal.
The United States already blacklists some individuals and entities for supporting IRGC activities, but not the Guards themselves. Designating the Guards as terrorists could make it more difficult for Iranian businesses to take advantage of the lifting of the international sanctions, since banks are required to verify that their clients are not on terrorism blacklists.

Iran’s rial has dropped against the U.S. dollar in recent days in a sign of concern about Trump’s policy. The rial was quoted in the free market around 40,400 to the dollar, currency exchangers in Tehran told Reuters, compared to 39,200 last week. Several exchangers said they had stopped selling dollars from Monday and were waiting to assess the trend in the market.
The government told Iranians on Tuesday it would not let the decisions of the “mentally unstable” Trump affect the market.
“Trump might say some things by the end of the week, but this should not create chaos in the market. Iran is a stable country, and nothing will happen,” government spokesman Mohammad Baqer Nobakht said in a weekly news conference.
Iran’s Central Bank governor, Valiollah Seif, was also quoted as saying by Tasnim news agency that “Trump’s words might have an emotional impact on the foreign exchange market, but it would not be long-term”.
Washington aims to put more pressure on the IRGC, especially over its missile programme. Trump said in September that recent IRGC missile tests illustrated the weakness of the nuclear deal.
Iran says the nuclear deal does not require it to restrict its missile programme.
Zarif, the Iranian foreign minister, said Iran purposefully excluded military capabilities from the pact, as “it is not intended as leverage or a bargaining chip in future negotiations”.
In an article published in the Atlantic magazine on Monday, Zarif added: “No party or country need fear our missiles ... unless it intends to attack our territory.”",REUTERS,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-irgc/iran-has-all-options-on-table-if-u-s-blacklists-revolutionary-guards-idUSKBN1CF0R0

Duping Americans And Wasting Taxpayers’ Money,"By Catherine J. Frompovich
I don’t know about you, but the brouhaha going on about “national pride” prior to sporting events, e.g., football games in particular, seems to be something apparently programmed to bring about a specific agenda, which most folks probably don’t recognize for what it truly is—another propaganda-like campaign following in the footsteps of “Public Relations founder/guru” Edward Bernays, whose strategies were to manipulate American minds to and for special vested interests’ agendas.
The video below may explain more than you thought about the apparent programmed displays people are using—and also are being used, in this writer’s opinion—to inadvertently program or even reprogram paying customers, i.e., fans and TV viewers, to emulate.
https://youtu.be/O_ilVrMaNvM?
Did you realize government agencies were paying the NFL to do what they do regarding the national anthem and standing at attention since 2009? Was “taking a knee” part of what those agencies paid for?
How does that make you feel? Suckered in to doing something just like taking mandated neurotoxic vaccines; surveillance AMI Smart Meters for your electric, natural gas and water utilities; Big Pharma’s and the medical professions’ opioid epidemic; GMO foods without proper labeling; breathing contaminants from weather geoengineering, aka “chemtrails”; fiat currency and on and on!
When will it ever stop? Not until enough people wake up and “smell the coffee” that’s brewing about changing the USA into a totally controlled surveillance state a la the UN’s Agenda 30, in this writer’s opinion, which I’m still entitled to by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution—but for how much longer, I really can’t say, since controls and programming mechanisms are increasing faster day-by-day.

In 2000 The Simpsons Predicted The Donald Trump Presidency,"I came across this video and I have to say I’m pretty mind blown.
 
I had to watch it a few times, because I could not believe the identical movements as well as the people’s behavior in the background of the cartoon and the actual video of Donald Trump in 2015.
 
For instance, when you watch the cartoon keep your eye on the man holding the sign that says “vote” at the top of the railing. You will see the sign drops to the ground.
 
When you watch the actual video of Donald Trump coming down the escalator, look in the same location of the railing and you will see a sign dropped to the floor.
 
Also, when Donald Trump comes down the escalator in the cartoon he waves and gives a thumbs up. In the actual video of Donald Trump coming down the escalator, 15 years later, he does the same exact thing.
 
You will even see that his election signage is the exact same as the Simpsons cartoon in the year 2000. I mean really… did Donald Trump get together with the Simpsons just to screw with us? Or is this just some kind of weird sh*t no one can explain?

Are Dems’ Late-Night Sock Puppets a Sign that the Fairness Doctrine Should be Restored?,"Are Dems’ Late-Night Sock Puppets a Sign that the Fairness Doctrine Should be Restored?

Once the word got out that late-night liberal favorite Jimmy Kimmel was receiving talking points on Obamacare directly from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer’s office, it became abundantly clear why there is so much anti-Trump material vomited up daily. Late night television has become a propaganda arm of the Democratic party and nothing less. Turn on any channel and you will find some smarmy leftist prick like foul-mouthed Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, the two Jimmies, Bill Maher and others turning their entire programs into anti-Trump diatribes. It used to be that late-night was about entertainment but the same can be said about the NFL. The latest egregious example of how politicized and aligned with the Dems that their Hollywood mouthpieces have become was the complete absence of jokes about Harvey Weinstein, the Democrat megadonor and Hollywood kingpin who is a rainmaker for the Dems. The victim of the ongoing attacks, President Trump has finally weighed in on this gross disparity in a series of Saturday morning tweets: Late Night host are dealing with the Democrats for their very “unfunny” & repetitive material, always anti-Trump!

"Very Violent Reversal Before End of 2017, N.Korea Thinks US is Bluffing – James Rickards, Greg Hunter Video","(Before It's News)
By Greg Hunter’s USAWatchdog.com 
 
 
 
Four time best-selling financial book author James Rickards says don’t get too comfortable with the record high stock prices. Rickards explains, “I think the markets will have a very violent reversal in late November or early December. Let me be specific about why because I never make claims like this without backing it up. . . . Here’s what’s going on. Right now, markets are priced for a Fed rate hike in December. . . . The stock market is interpreting this rate hike as economic strength . . . everything is set for a violent reversal because the Fed is not going to hike interest rates in December.”

So, why is the Fed not going to raise rates? Rickards says it’s because of not enough inflation and way too much deflation. This has the Fed scared to move. Rickards contends, “Why is deflation a central bank’s worst nightmare? The answer is deflation increases the real value of debt. In other words, the dollar actually gets stronger in a deflationary environment. If I owe you dollars, and the dollar just got stronger, I owe you more money in real terms. It becomes more difficult to pay off debt in a deflationary environment because my income is drying up. The real burden of debt is going up, and if I couldn’t pay you to begin with, deflation is going to make it more difficult to repay you. . . . Imagine if we had one or two percent deflation . . . and the value of the debt was going up. The defaults would be even worse. Bad debts would pile up. The banking system would be under threat. Tax collections would go down in nominal terms. The credit of the U.S. government would be called into question. The U.S. government might default. These are all the horrendous consequences of deflation, and it’s why central banks cannot have deflation.”
 
So, what happens if Rickards is correct and the Fed does not raise rates? Rickards says, “When that happens, and I think it will happen . . . all of a sudden, the dollar is going to get weaker, the euro is going to get stronger, gold is going to go up and bonds are going to rally. So, there will be a lot of big market effects. I am not talking the end of the world . . . . I am not talking about a total meltdown. I am talking about a violent repricing of some major commodities and bonds . . . because the market thinks the Fed is going to raise, and they’re not.”
 
Is there a danger in October as many believe there could be? Rickards says “yes,” and it comes from increased tensions with North Korea. Rickards says, “We have a window from October 10th to October 21st. What is the significance of that window? October 10th is the anniversary of the communist party of North Korea. Kim Jong Un is getting ready to test more missiles. . . . We have two catalysts. The anniversary on October 10th and war games (with South Korea) on October 21st. In that window is when I expect one or more missile tests. That’s going to be another wake up call to the markets. The markets are sleepwalking . . . they don’t understand this war is coming, and it is coming. A shooting war, a pre-emptive war, a kinetic war with the United States against North Korea, I do expect by mid-2018. . . . Kim Jong Un thinks we are bluffing. We are not.”
 
Rickards also restates his case for “$10,000 gold” and contends it’s at a relatively low price, and people should buy it now and simply hold it.

"New Documents Show Pentagon Is Shipping Billions Worth Of Weapons To Terrorists In Syria, Trying To Cover Its Tracks","By Brandon Turbeville
While Donald Trump garnered praise from many anti-imperialist activists and researchers after his public announcement that he was ending the CIA’s program of arming terrorists in Syria, it appears much of that praise will be short-lived. Certainly, many expected a sleight of hand from the Trump administration and the Deep State, and now evidence has surfaced showing that the U.S. government has simply shifted the focus of arming terrorists from one agency to another.
Trump never ended the Pentagon program, viewed as a much smaller initiative. However, documents recently revealed are showing that the program is officially set to continue in the arena of $2 billion over the next five or so years. Given the secrecy of the program, however, many believe the monetary value of the weapons shipments is much higher.
A new report released by two international weapons monitoring groups, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), confirmed on Tuesday that the Pentagon is continuing to ship massive amounts of weapons to Syria. In addition, the Department of Defense is attempting to destroy its own paper trail. Both the OCCRP and the BIRN provided conclusive evidence that the Pentagon is shipping in up to $2.2 billion worth of weapons from private weapons dealers to terrorists in Syria. They also provided evidence that the DOD is altering paperwork such as end-user certificates in order to hide its involvement.
This story now echoes the early revelations made by Bulgarian reporter Dilyana Gaytandzhieva who reported on the use of diplomatic flights as cover for weapons shipments by the anti-Syria coalition from those countries to terrorists in Syria, Yemen, and other locations. Gaytandzhieva was subsequently interrogated and fired from her job at Trud.
The OCCRP and BIRN actually published a number of internal US Defense procurement files after their own extensive investigation. These files showed that the Pentagon is running a major weapons trafficking pipeline that reaches from the Balkans and the Caucuses but which ends in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The program is part of the “train and equip” program for the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces), a collection of Arab Muslim terrorists and fanatical Kurds mainly from the FSA (Free Syrian Army) and YPG respectively.
The mouthpiece of the Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Policy, has covered the issue as well. FP’s article states,
The Department of Defense has budgeted $584 million specifically for this Syrian operation for the financial years 2017 and 2018, and has earmarked another $900 million of spending on Soviet-style munitions between now and 2022. The total, $2.2 billion, likely understates the flow of weapons to Syrian rebels in the coming years. . . . . . According to the report, many of the weapons suppliers — primarily in Eastern Europe but also in the former Soviet republics, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine — have both links to organized crime throughout Eastern Europe and spotty business records. The sheer amount of material necessary for the Pentagon program — one ammunition factory announced it planned to hire 1,000 new employees in 2016 to help cope with the demand — has reportedly stretched suppliers to the limit, forcing the Defense Department to relax standards on the materials it’s willing to accept..
As Zero Hedge comments,
It is likely that the organized crime association is the reason why the Pentagon has sought to alter its records. In addition, the sheer volume of weaponry continuing to ship to the Syrian battlefield and other parts of the Middle East means inevitable proliferation among unsavory terror groups – a phenomenon which has already been exhaustively documented in connection with the now reportedly closed CIA program to topple the Syrian government. The associations and alliances among some of the Arab former FSA groups the DoD continues to support in the north and east remains fluid, which means means US-supplied weapons will continue to pass among groups with no accountability for where they end up. Seven of the documents published by the two international watchdog organizations show clear doctoring and tampering by the DOD. In some of the original documents, one can see the end user listed. After the document has been tampered with, the end user has been removed. The Firearms Survival Guide (Ad) Ivan Angelovski, one of the authors of the watchdog report, told Foreign Policy that, “The Pentagon is removing any evidence in their procurement records that weapons are actually going to the Syrian opposition.”
Balkan Insight, the website that is hosting the report, states that “Seven US procurement documents were whitewashed to remove reference to ‘Syria’ after reporters contacted the Pentagon to enquire about whether the exporting countries – Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine and Georgia – had been informed of the destination.”
Foreign Policy, which has traditionally acted as the cheerleader for any and all operations undertaken to destroy the Syrian government, also stated that the U.S. policy is “turbocharging” the “shadowy world of Eastern European arms dealers.” While not shocking, the reports both confirm the information documented by Gaytandzhieva and the fact that the United States is continuing to move ahead with the arming of terrorists in Syria, most likely with the idea of Balkanization and Federalization in mind for the future. At best, the terrorists being used for Balkanization and the creation of Kurdistan has taken precedence over and replaced the terrorists being used for a direct assault on the Syrian government. At worst, it is a sleight of hand by the Trump administration designed to distract and divert attention from America’s terrorist mill.

Bizarre Things That Just Don’t Make Sense About The Las Vegas Mass Shooting False Flag Event
 
 
 
 Written by JayWill7497

They’re engaging us with engineered psychological warfare to destabilize a demographic to sanction more control or deflect from an occurrence they’re pushing through. I’ve read some believe this is to deflect from the NFL ordeal nevertheless, the past deep state moves were mirrored prior to justifying UN globalist legislation to incrementally turn the thumbscrews to enslave us further…
 
 
My prayers go out to all those supposedly killed or injured in the Las Vegas shooting, and in a country where so many anti-Americans are kneeling in pampered protest, this mass shooting observed veterans and police officers standing up, assisting the victims and maneuvering directly for the shooter to take him out. Of course we all understand dead man tells no tales. Real Americans don’t kneel, they stand and get to work to save lives. Currently I give tremendous gratitude to all the first responders who helped save lives and end the violence.
 
Despite the fact that the news reporting on this shooting is still in its early stages, there are five bizarre things that just don’t add up about this carnage. I run through them below.
 
#1) Masses of concert-goers reported the presence of multiple shooters
 
 
Although law enforcement claims there was only one shooter, multiple witnesses are publicly reporting the presence of multiple shooters. This could reasonably be the response to confusion and chaos, but it’s also highly suspect that the shooter had “full auto” weapon which is typically limited to law enforcement or military personnel.
 
This question about multiple shooters was also raised after the Aurora, Colorado “Batman movie theater” shooting, in which countless witnesses reported the presence of multiple shooters.
 
If this shooting was executed by multiple shooters, it would clearly suggest planning and coordination among a group of individuals who sought to carry out the shooting for a political purpose of some kind.
 
#2) Who informed concert-goers they were “all going to die” a full 45 minutes before the shooting began?
 
 
Via the UK Express:
 
One woman, who was at the Route 91 music event, claimed an unidentified woman had told other concert-goers they were “all going to die” after pushing her way to the front of the venue.
 
The witness, 21, told local news: “She had been messing with a lady in front of her and telling her she was going to die, that we were all going to die.
 
“They escorted her out to make her stop messing around with all the other people, but none of us knew it was going to be serious.”
 
She described the lady as Hispanic. The lady was escorted from the venue along with a man.
 
The unnamed witness, who was attending the event on her 21st birthday, described the pair as short, both around 5 ft 5ins to 5ft 6ins tall, and looked like “everyday people”.
 
It’s obvious that neither of these two individuals were the shooter, as the shooter is a much taller Caucasian dude. Therefore, this is not a “lone gunman” massacre. There was coordination. At least three individuals were mindful this shooting was about to take place.
 
#3) The weapon you pick up on videos was FULL AUTO, which is almost improbable to obtain through legal means
 
 
The multitude of videos that captured the situation plainly reveal that at least one shooter was running a full auto weapons system. Such weapons are almost unattainable for “civilians” to purchase. Although some pre-1986 full auto weapons are accessible for sale, they call for extensive ATF documentation, background checks and extremely long wait periods approaching one year. Additionally, they tend to cost $25,000 or more, and they’re incredibly rare.
 
Full auto weapons, on the other hand, are commonly owned by police officers, federal officials and military organizations. It will be very fascinating to find out where this weapon came from and exactly how it was obtained.
 
#4) Why were the exits obstructed, trapping suckers like rats in a maze?
 
Countless reports from witnesses who were on the scene disclose that practically all the exits were obstructed. One witness detailed the scenario as “being caught like a rate in a maze” with many “dead ends.”
 
Why were practically all the exits blocked? Basically, the concert created a kill zone that amplified the casualties. Until now, based on the Clark County Sheriff in Vegas, 515 individuals have been injured and 59 folks have so far died. These are unspeakable numbers, drawing near war-time casualty counts. It’s apparent from the coverage that this shockingly high body count would not have been likely if folks had been free to flee the concert venue.
 
Basically, the concert trapped the folks, preventing them from escaping, and denying them the capacity to seek cover. From there, continual, full-auto gunfire is almost improbable to survive.
 
Furthermore, once the shooting began, the stage lights were aimed to the crowd, lighting up the audience and making them an much easier target for the shooter(s). Was this planned?
 
#5) So why did the shooter have as many as 10 firearms in his room?
 
Based on news reports, the shooter – known as Stephen Paddock – had as many as 10 firearms in his room, which include several rifles. If he was the sole shooter, what’s the issue of using so many rifles? One dude can clearly only shoot one rifle, and since he possessed a full auto rifle, he could clearly accomplish his evil aims by concentrating on his one rifle. There was no demand for him to have numerous rifles.
 
Hence were the other rifles contributed to the room to “stage” the crime scene with an large quantity of guns? Why would one elderly man make an effort to carry 8 – 10 weapons to a hotel room to begin with? That’s a lot of work. Rifles are not lightweight equipment.
 
I get the concept that a lone, elderly man would carry so many rifles to a hotel room for no sensible reason to be tremendously suspect. It makes no sense at all.

"A ‘Dynasty’ for Generation ‘Gossip Girl’ (Mom Can Watch, Too)","The new show arrives Oct. 11 on the CW, whose youth-centered programming has lately relied, with middling results, on superheroes. It has been not so much created as concocted by Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz — who sold soap to an Axe body wash generation with “Gossip Girl” and “The O.C.” — as a layer cake of nostalgia and novelty to tempt both extremes of the 18-49 demographic so coveted by advertisers.
Photo
“We’re changing up the point of entry,” Mr. Schwartz said. “If you were a fan of the original, it honors the spirit of that. And then those new to the show should be ready for a fun, twisted serial.”
“Downton Abbey” and “Billions” have showed that viewers still enjoy the foibles of the rich. But reboots have become iffy propositions, with originals readily available on Amazon Prime and in DVD box sets. The revival of “Dallas,” on TNT, was canceled after three seasons in 2014, even with the draw of original cast members. “Dynasty” has none thus far (one, Gordon Thomson, called the new show “an abomination” in an interview with The Daily Beast). Some fans, however, have hopefully proposed Heather Locklear, the original Sammy Jo and another “Melrose” veteran, to play Alexis, Cristal’s archrival.
But she was nowhere in evidence here this summer on a cavernous soundstage, which was home to an update of the Carrington mansion, where this reporter spent many happy escapist hours as a pre-teen, learning nothing less than how to be a woman.
“Lip-plumping treatments,” Mr. Show, compactly handsome at 55, was muttering in between takes, rolling the phrase around in his mouth like one of the top-shelf brandies Mr. Forsythe’s Blake Carrington favored. “Lip-plumping treatments.”
Blake had just delivered to his headstrong daughter, Fallon (Elizabeth Gillies), the bad news that their family name had been trademarked by her mother, his ex-wife Alexis, for a cosmetics line.
Photo
The “Dynasty” name was also tarnished by the time Mr. Show met Mr. Spelling, whose Holmby Hills, Calif., mansion seemed a version of Blake Carrington’s, on “Melrose.” He remembered the older man as strict and stingy, using so-called honey wagons to remove sewage rather than install proper plumbing, but also possessing a certain thespian gravitas.

“Aaron used to say, putting his hands up and framing your face in a very square, ‘just your face’ way, ‘My shows are all about character,’” Mr. Show said during a break in taping, sitting at a dining table surrounded by expensive art. “He filmed straight-on, close to camera. You could tell an Aaron show in less than a second.”
The new “Dynasty,” in contrast, has Ms. Savage and Mr Schwartz’s own distinct aesthetic. Scenes are shorter: three or four minutes as opposed to six or seven. Skirts are also shorter. Music is louder. Lighting is dimmer. Slo-mo is occasionally deployed. And knowing references are rife, including to Trumps, Kardashians and Murdochs.
That the White House currently contains a real-estate tycoon— familiar from the ’80s, yet — and his scions makes “Dynasty” seem particularly resonant, though of course tangling bloodlines are a dramatic device as old as the ancient Greeks. “From the Clintons to the Kennedys, this isn’t a new thing, our fascination with these really powerful families,” said Nathalie Kelley, who plays Cristal. “But one thing we’ve talked about which is interesting is patriarchy — how much it has shifted, and how much it’s stayed the same.”
The former Krystle (Linda Evans) had been Blake’s secretary, positioned in perpetual saintly opposition to the devious Alexis and meekly tiptoeing around the Carrington mansion like the nameless heroine of Daphne du Maurier’s “Rebecca.”
Photo
“In the original Blake is shutting the door in her face because she has to have a meeting and she’s trying to get a word in about the china or something,” Ms. Kelley said. “She’s not really given much to do besides be beautiful and look after the house.”
This Cristal begins in public relations and goes on to contest fiercely with Fallon to become chief operating officer of the Carrington energy company.
She is also young enough to be his daughter, though Ms. Kelley argued that at 33 she is past an age that could provoke eye rolls. “When I first met with Josh and Stephanie, I was like, ‘I think Cristal needs to be at least in her 30s,’” she said. “I don’t think women around the world are going to be happy with this rich billionaire in his 50s dating someone who’s under 30, and that threshold makes a big difference.”
As Mr. Show put it: “People are younger today. The whole show’s younger.”
Indeed if any demographic is neglected in the new version, it is the Modern Maturity set. Ms. Collins was 48 when she first swept into the courtroom when Blake was being tried for the murder of his son Steven’s male lover; Mr. Forsythe was 63. Later additions from the golden age of Hollywood, Diahann Carroll and Rock Hudson, were in their 50s — the latter’s death of AIDS in 1985 provoking a national conversation about whether he’d jeopardized Ms. Evans’s health with their onscreen kiss.

As the cast awaits its Alexis, conflict has been heightened between Cristal and Fallon: a role played first by Pamela Sue Martin, then known for “Nancy Drew” and “The Poseidon Adventure,” and subsequently by the British actress Emma Samms, in one of those switcheroos that soap viewers are supposed to accept unblinkingly but now discuss for years afterward in searchable online forums. (A casting change for Steven was attributed to plastic surgery following an explosive accident on an oil rig, but producers decided simply to ignore Fallon’s change in appearance.)
Photo
As embodied by Ms. Gillies, Fallon has been upgraded from a somewhat lost soul, climbing in and out of beds and winsomely up trees — and later, on a spin-off called “The Colbys,” being abducted by aliens — to an ambitious businesswoman, still sleeping with the chauffeur but now also leaning in with a steely glare.
Ms. Gillies, 24, said she had admired Ms. Collins since seeing her in “The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas” as a child and now regularly retweets the older woman’s Throwback Thursday hashtags to her own 4.6 million followers (thanks mainly to her role on “Victorious”). “I’m not playing Alexis but Fallon has inherited a lot of her gusto,” Ms. Gillies said. “She’s less passive than at least Pamela Sue Martin was — she had a relaxed nature. I wouldn’t say that my Fallon is as relaxed, for better or for worse. I think she’s got a lot more bite.”
She is also entwined enough with Blake that some early viewers have suggested her character resembles Ivanka Trump, and for them Ms. Gillies has developed a one-line rejoinder: “I have better shoes,” she said, striding away in a pair of Christian Louboutin heels.
Neither iteration of “Dynasty” can be separated from its devotion to materialism and the one percent. “I just have memories of how white the rooms were, the carpet — that’s what the rich have,” said Ms. Patrick, the showrunner, who grew up in Atlanta.
But the very rich are not only different from you and me, but from how they used to be. The 2017 Colbys made their money in tech, the Carrington children are concerned about the environment and everyone accepts differences in race and sexual orientation unblinkingly. The once dithering Steven is now “gay and proud,” Ms. Patrick said. “That’s not his issue with his father; it’s that he’s a liberal.”
Mr. Show said he thought “this Blake has a lot more pathology” than his predecessor. Crew members were hammering behind him at the opulent set, with its staircase built for flouncing down O‘Hara-style, and twinkling chandeliers.
“He tells untruths when he doesn’t need to and I don’t know why yet, I’m developing the character,” Mr. Show said. “I’m taking that as seriously as I possibly can, and then it cuts to a catfight.”",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/06/arts/television/dynasty-reboot-cw.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Farts

"Disney, Hillary Clinton and the Obamas Condemn Weinstein","Former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, also released a statement about Mr. Weinstein, saying that “any man who demeans and degrades women in such fashion needs to be condemned and held accountable, regardless of wealth or status.” The Obamas’ older daughter, Malia, was an intern at the Weinstein Company this year.

The Weinstein Company’s board said in a statement on Tuesday that it was “shocked and dismayed” by the allegations. “These alleged actions are antithetical to human decency,” the board said. One-third of the company’s all-male board had resigned on Friday.
Also on Tuesday, Georgina Chapman, Mr. Weinstein’s wife, told People magazine that she was leaving him. And the University of Southern California’s School of Cinematic Arts said it had decided to reject his earlier pledge to fund a $5 million endowment for female filmmakers.
Mr. Eisner and Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was then in charge of Disney’s movie divisions, bought Miramax in 1993 for $80 million. At the time, Miramax was becoming a superpower in the art film business by turning offbeat, inexpensive movies into mainstream hits. It was in 1992, for instance, that Miramax released the micro-budgeted thriller “The Crying Game,” which collected $62 million at the box office, or $110 million in today’s dollars.
On Tuesday, Mr. Katzenberg released an email that he sent to Mr. Weinstein on Sunday and that said he was “sickened” by the allegations. “There appear to be two Harvey Weinsteins … one that I have known well, appreciated and admired and another that I have not known at all,” Mr. Katzenberg’s email said.

Robert A. Iger, Disney’s current chief executive, said in a separate statement, “Harvey Weinstein’s reported behavior is abhorrent and unacceptable, and it has no place in our society.” Disney sold Miramax in 2010 for $660 million.
The flurry of comments came five days after a New York Times investigation chronicled a hidden history of sexual harassment allegations against Mr. Weinstein, including settlements paid, often involving former employees, over three decades. On Sunday, the Weinstein Company fired him, citing “new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein.”
In response to the allegations, Mr. Weinstein has acknowledged that his behavior “caused a lot of pain.” But a spokeswoman, Sallie Hofmeister, also said he “unequivocally denied” any allegations of nonconsensual sex.
Disney’s purchase of Miramax included provisions that shielded Miramax from corporate interference. The Weinsteins were given the ability to “greenlight” films with budgets of tens of millions of dollars without approval from Disney. Miramax also got to retain its own chief financial officer, head of human relations and general counsel.
According to reports at the time, the brothers demanded the autonomy, arguing that their films — which would include rough-and-rowdy titles like “Pulp Fiction,” released in 1994 — could not be incubated inside a corporate environment.
While with Disney, Miramax released more than 300 movies, which generated $5 billion in North American ticket sales and tallied at least 220 Academy Award nominations and 53 wins, including best picture Oscars for “Shakespeare in Love,” “The English Patient” and “Chicago.”

But Disney also clashed bitterly with the Weinsteins, who took advantage of their autonomy to start an expensive magazine, Talk, without approval and to move forward with the political documentary “Fahrenheit 9/11” despite being told that Disney would not distribute it. At the time, executives at Disney said Miramax had hidden its financing of that film by not including it on monthly reports about films in development; Miramax officials countered that they were aboveboard.",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/business/media/disney-hillary-clinton-and-the-obamas-condemn-weinstein.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fpolitics

Lawrence Thomas Officially Makes Switch to Fullback,"Lawrence Thomas Officially Makes Switch to Fullback
% of readers think this story is Fact. Add your two cents.
(Before It's News)
When Jets defensive lineman Lawrence Thomas lined up at fullback early in the teams match up with the Dolphins two weeks ago, nobody knew if it was a gimmick, a wild experiment, or a tryout.
Whatever you want to call it, the Jets obviously liked what they saw as Thomas got more looks at fullback again the following week against the Jacksonville Jaguars and threw a few key blocks to spring Bilal Powell free to break away and pick up some big gainers.
Now, it appears to be a full-time gig.
Lawrence Thomas changed numbers to 44. He is officially a fullback #NYJ — Brian Costello (@BrianCoz) October 4, 2017
Thomas emerged at practice in Florham Park today wearing number 44, a switch from his defensive line number of 97.
A former college fullback at Michigan State before switching to the D-line, acting as a lead blocker isn’t entirely new for Thomas. If his early results are any indicator as to how he’ll play moving forward, the Jets may have one heck of a 285 lb battering ram filling the role of lead blocker better than anyone the Jets have had since Tony Richardson.

Netflix fends off criticism over Canada investment,"FILE PHOTO: The Netflix logo is pictured on a television in this illustration photograph taken in Encinitas, California, U.S., on January 18, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake/File Photo
(Reuters) - Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) said on Tuesday it had received formal approval to start a C$500 million production unit in Canada and sought to quell talk that it had asked for special tax benefits for investing in its first such unit outside the United States.
The maker of Emmy-winning shows such as The Crown and Black Mirror said last month it was in talks with the Canadian government for an investment over a minimum of five years.
That decision was part of a broad review under Canadian Heritage Minister Melanie Joly, which included plans to modernize funding programs and review copyright, broadcasting and telecommunications legislation.
The government did not tax Netflix as some had proposed, opening the streaming service provider to criticism in Canada. (bit.ly/2wLo4Ma)
Netflix said on Tuesday its Canadian investment was approved under the Investment Canada Act, and that no tax deals were part of the approval to launch its new Canadian presence. But is also said it was not paying sales tax in line with existing Canadian laws.
""Netflix follows tax laws everywhere we operate. Under Canadian law, foreign online services like Netflix aren't required to collect and remit sales tax,"" said Corie Wright, Netflix's director of global public policy. (nflx.it/2yBTf11)
The company also said it would spend an additional C$25 million ($20 million) over five years toward “market development” in the country, hosting recruitment drives and cultural events to boost the local production community.",REUTERS,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netflix-canada/netflix-fends-off-criticism-over-canada-investment-idUSKBN1CF18Z

Kenyan Election Officials Open New Vote to All Original Candidates,"But in its ruling, the court found that senior poll officials had not followed electoral procedures properly to ensure a credible vote. It was the first time in Africa that a court had nullified the election of an incumbent.
For weeks since the court ruling, Mr. Odinga has demanded that senior poll officials be replaced and prosecuted. He has also called for the replacement of the companies in charge of printing ballot papers and providing the devices needed for the electronic transmission of results, areas that the court found to have been flawed.
Western diplomats have criticized Mr. Odinga for making too many demands, which could have the effect of undermining confidence in the electoral commission’s ability to hold the new vote. Mr. Odinga has called for protests to take place until the commission makes the changes he seeks.
On Wednesday, hundreds of his supporters demonstrated in Nairobi, the capital, and in some opposition strongholds around the country, demanding the resignation of senior election officials.

“Can you go into an election with the same cooks who poisoned your food?” said Janet Ongera, an opposition lawmaker from Kisii, a city in western Kenya.
“This will add even more sulfuric acid,” Ms. Ongera added. “What we want is a level playing field.”
Since the Supreme Court’s ruling in September, Mr. Odinga and Mr. Kenyatta, along with the electoral commission, have failed to reach an agreement on how to conduct the new election.
Analysts say that with shrinking campaign funds and worries of eroding support, Mr. Odinga was most likely playing for time by withdrawing from the race.

Mr. Odinga appeared to be pushing for a later date for the new election, based on his interpretation of a 2013 ruling that calls for a new vote to take place within 90 days if a candidate suddenly dies. An extended campaign would give the authorities more time to make the electoral changes sought by Mr. Odinga.
Earlier in the day, before the election commission’s decision, Kenya’s Parliament passed a set of amendments to the electoral law that seemed intended to ensure a victory by Mr. Kenyatta. One measure said that in an election or runoff with only two candidates, if one withdraws, the other would be automatically declared the winner.
Another amendment would bar the Supreme Court from nullifying a presidential election unless violations of the Constitution or electoral law significantly altered the outcome.
That measure was widely criticized as an attempt by the government to clip the judiciary’s wings. Although the parliamentary vote was boycotted by opposition lawmakers, it passed with the support of Mr. Kenyatta’s party.",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/world/africa/kenya-election-kenyatta-odinga.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Fworld

Some Tips for Selecting The Best Flower Bouquet Online,"Some Tips for Selecting The Best Flower Bouquet Online
(Before It's News)
Sending flowers and bouquets to your loved ones as a sign of your love as well as a gift for any special occasion is a gesture many of us do. There are different types of gift options which you have, but a flower bouquet is an endless classic choice which you can give along with another gift too.

Here we are going to provide you with some tips which would help you find the best flower bouquet for your gifting purpose online very quickly.
Always go for an established store
There are many online stores for flowers and bouquets, and you can always get a quality bouquet from the stores which are reputed and established over a period. There are different types of flowers, and if the website is built and have a consistent reputation for their quality maintenance, you can be sure that the flowers would be fresh and superior in quality. Usually, a store is not very reliable in that way would have quality issues and since the flowers would eventually wilt it is imperative that you get a flower bouquet which is made from the freshest flowers that the store can get.
Types of bouquet
There are different types of bouquet which you can find at the stores. Go to an online website with a high-quality image of the bouquets which they have, and you can get a fair idea of the way it would look. Keep in mind that bouquets of different flowers have different longevity and hence you must maintain this factor in mind when you are shopping for a bouquet. Some bouquets contain wild flowers as well which are not always that durable and may wilt by the time it has been delivered to the place where you want to send it. Also, opt for medium sized bouquets rather than something that is extremely significant since the chances of damage during transit is always high with such bouquets.
Budget and shipping

A fishing trawler capsized on the Naf River late Sunday evening local time, said Ariful Islam, commanding officer of the Bangladesh Border Guard in Teknaf, on the border with Myanmar.
Islam said his team rescued 13 people by pulling them from the water into their boats.
""They (were) so distressed,"" Islam said of those rescued. ""We have provided them with first aid and food. Now they are in the camps.""
He added it was unclear how many people were on board the boat or if any are still missing: ""You never know, we might find more bodies.""

"Happy 350,000th birthday: Study pushes back Homo sapiens origins","Dr. Helena Malmström conducting on-site sampling of bone material in a mobile sampling lab pictured in this handout photo obtained by Reuters September 28, 2017. Mattias Jakobsson/Handout via REUTERS
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Genetic data from the skeletal remains of seven people who lived centuries ago in South Africa’s KwaZulu-Natal Province is offering intriguing new evidence that our species, Homo sapiens, is older than previously believed.
Scientists said on Thursday they sequenced the genomes of the seven individuals including a boy who lived as a hunter-gatherer at Ballito Bay roughly 2,000 years ago. In doing so, they were able to estimate that the evolutionary split between Homo sapiens and ancestral human groups occurred 260,000 to 350,000 years ago.
Until recently, the prevailing belief was that Homo sapiens arose a bit before 200,000 years ago. The new study and fossil discoveries from Morocco announced in June indicate a much older origin.
Homo sapiens emerged on the African landscape following millions of years of human evolution, including a split 600,000 to 700,000 years ago from the lineage that led to the now-extinct Neanderthals. The period from that split until the advent of our species was a critical one.
“In this time period, some genetic changes may have happened that make us humans who we are today, and distinct from, for example, Neanderthals,” said population geneticist Mattias Jakobsson of Uppsala University in Sweden, co-leader of the research published in the journal Science.
“The reconstruction of deep human history in Africa is becoming increasingly robust when the dating of fossils, such as those from Morocco, the Stone Age archaeological record and human DNA come together to highlight interesting periods in our evolutionary past,” added study co-leader Marlize Lombard, a University of Johannesburg professor of Stone Age archaeology.
The Morocco findings reported in June by other researchers involved fossil skulls, limb bones and teeth roughly 300,000 years old that they concluded were from Homo sapiens.
“The age of those fossils at 300,000 years also falls within our new estimate for the emergence of Homo sapiens. They show a combination of modern and archaic features, which could indicate a transitional phase in our evolution,” Lombard said of the Moroccan remains.
Scientists also have concluded that a 260,000-year-old partial cranium from Florisbad, South Africa, also represented Homo sapiens.
There is broad agreement among scientists that Homo sapiens originated in Africa. But the recent discoveries have suggested our species arose not in one locale like east Africa but in multiple places, a more complex so-called pan-African origin that the new genetic research seems to support.

Kids & Fitness....Get the Kids Off the Couch & Have Some Fun!,"Kids & Fitness….Get the Kids Off the Couch & Have Some Fun!
(Before It's News)
We live in a time when there are too many things kids can do to entertain themselves while remaining inactive: television and movies, smart phones, video games and social media and of course what my kid loves to do…sleep!
So how can you get your kids to jump off the couch, put down whatever electronic device they’re holding, and join you for a bit of good old fashioned exercise?
The Right Approach
Encourage your kids to exercise! Experience tell us the best way to get your kids to exercise is to set a positive example. So you have to get the party started…grab your FlexFit Mat, lay it out in the living room floor, and invite your kids to join you. Whether or not they do so (they probably won’t at first), make sure you run through some exercises of your own.
Young children love to spend time with their parents, and the more they see you exercising without them, the more they will want to come and join you. For older kids, you might have to work better Jedi mind tricks on them and make it challenging. Competition works great: see who can do the most sit-ups, push-ups, or plank the longest (hint: let them win a few times). Keep a chart in the kitchen with daily results and create an end-of-summer reward.
Make it Fun!
When your kids finally do join you, be sure to make your workout as fun as possible! You could get ambitious like this dad who created a American Ninja Warrior obstacle course for his daughter in the backyard!
For the parents that don’t have the time or resources to make their own mini Mount Midoriyama at home, try setting up a series of exercises that tell a story, or turn on some music and invent a new dance, or create your own iron-kid contest. Use your imagination! After a while, you might be surprised to see how much your kids look forward to working out with you.",Before It News,"http://beforeitsnews.com/sports/2017/09/kids-fitness-get-the-kids-off-the-couch-have-some-fun-2701071.html

Exclusive: EU regulators set to approve Atlantia's bid for Abertis - sources,"MILAN/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Italian toll-road group Atlantia’s 17 billion-euro ($20 billion) bid for Spain’s Abertis (ABE.MC) is set to win EU approval, sources said on Tuesday, clearing another hurdle to getting the long-awaited deal done unless a counter-bid emerges.
Three sources with knowledge of the matter said that EU antitrust regulators were set to give unconditional approval to the bid on Friday.
Atlantia, which announced in May its proposal to acquire Abertis to create the world’s largest toll-road operator, formally launched the cash-and-shares offer on Tuesday, a day after receiving the go-ahead from the Spanish market regulator.
The start of the offer period, which runs until Oct. 24, puts pressure on potential counter-bidder ACS (ACS.MC), the Spanish construction group, to show its hand.
Under Spanish rules ACS, which said in July it was considering making its own offer for Abertis, has until Oct. 19 to present an alternative proposal.
“The clock starts ticking for ACS,” Kepler Cheuvreux analyst Joaquin Ferrer said in a note, cutting the broker’s rating on the stock to a “hold” from a “buy” due to the possibility of a bidding war between Atlantia and ACS.
Atlantia’s shares were down 1.1 percent at 27.46 euros at 1406 GMT. Shares in ACS, which declined to comment, were down 1 percent at 30.51 euros while shares in Abertis were down 0.1 percent at 17.33 euros.
Atlantia is offering 16.50 euros in cash or 0.697 Atlantia shares for each Abertis share. But the offer is conditional on shareholders owning between 10 percent and 23 percent of the Spanish company’s capital accepting the share offer.
POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY
At current market prices Atlantia will spend between 16.6 billion and 17 billion euros to buy Abertis. Back in May the deal was worth just over 16 billion euros but Atlantia’s shares have risen 12 percent since then.
Spanish media reports have said ACS was considering an all-cash offer at 17 euros per share for Abertis and would team up with infrastructure and investment funds to raise the money needed to pay cash.
Political uncertainty over the situation in Catalonia, where the local government was considering the possibility of unilaterally declaring independence from Spain later on Tuesday, could also complicate any deal.
Abertis is based in Barcelona and its top shareholder is Criteria Caixa, the financial arm of a politically connected and powerful banking foundation that controls Caixabank (CABK.MC), one of Catalonia’s biggest lenders.
However, the company’s board on Monday agreed to relocate its head office to Madrid, joining a business exodus from the region. ACS is based in Madrid and its chairman Florentino Perez is also at the helm of soccer club Real Madrid.
Political interference in the past blocked a planned tie-up between Atlantia and Abertis - a merger deal was scrapped in 2006 because of Italian government opposition.",REUTERS,"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-abertis-m-a-atlantia-eu-exclusive/exclusive-eu-regulators-to-approve-atlantia-abertis-deal-sources-idUSKBN1CF17Z

France still not confirmed IS links to Marseille attacker,"French authorities say they have not confirmed any links between the Tunisian man who stabbed two women to death at the Marseille train station and the Islamic State group or radical Islam.
A French legal official told The Associated Press on Wednesday that the attacker had recently viewed videos of Islamic chants sometimes associated with IS. The official stressed, however, the videos made no reference to IS and authorities have no clear evidence the assailant was radicalized — despite an IS claim of responsibility for Sunday's stabbing.
The official said the attacker's motive remains unclear. He was shot dead after the attack.
Four men and one woman close to him remained in custody Wednesday and face potential terrorist charges, the official said. He spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the investigation.",ABC News,http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/france-confirmed-links-marseille-attacker-50273253,0
North Korea's Other Threat: Why EMP Becomes An Extinction Level Event,"Every 94 minutes two North Korean satellites silently pass over the United States.
 
The first launched in 2011 and the second launched in 2016, they are orbiting at what is considered to be the optimum height for creating an EMP field that would cover all of the 48 contiguous United States.
 
The strength of the EMP is determined by the height at which it is created, such an EMP would have devastating consequences. It would destroy our electrical grid. All of our critical civilian infrastructure would be devastated as well. There would be no food, no water, no hospitals, no communications.
 
Those events may be alarming but they would be survivable by most. The real danger of an EMP event lies elsewhere. It is a danger that turns an EMP into an ELE. An extinction level event. It's a threat not many dare to mention. Only whispered about in certain circles and some of the more serious survivalist blogs.
 
That danger is posed by our nuclear power plants. Littered across the country the United States has over 100 nuclear power plants scattered around the nation. Nuclear power plants are depedant on the main grid. All of those facilities would quickly go into meltdown as their back up systems fail. The time frame would be anything from 24 hours to four weeks.
 
Technology has improved our lives immensely, made it easier, simpler and more entertaining. Some of those technologies however pose a great threat. Threats that we should try to limit in order to safeguard both our lives and our way of life.

"New Documents Show Pentagon Is Shipping Billions Worth Of Weapons To Terrorists In Syria, Trying To Cover Its Tracks","By Brandon Turbeville
While Donald Trump garnered praise from many anti-imperialist activists and researchers after his public announcement that he was ending the CIA’s program of arming terrorists in Syria, it appears much of that praise will be short-lived. Certainly, many expected a sleight of hand from the Trump administration and the Deep State, and now evidence has surfaced showing that the U.S. government has simply shifted the focus of arming terrorists from one agency to another.
Trump never ended the Pentagon program, viewed as a much smaller initiative. However, documents recently revealed are showing that the program is officially set to continue in the arena of $2 billion over the next five or so years. Given the secrecy of the program, however, many believe the monetary value of the weapons shipments is much higher.
A new report released by two international weapons monitoring groups, the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project (OCCRP) and Balkan Investigative Reporting Network (BIRN), confirmed on Tuesday that the Pentagon is continuing to ship massive amounts of weapons to Syria. In addition, the Department of Defense is attempting to destroy its own paper trail. Both the OCCRP and the BIRN provided conclusive evidence that the Pentagon is shipping in up to $2.2 billion worth of weapons from private weapons dealers to terrorists in Syria. They also provided evidence that the DOD is altering paperwork such as end-user certificates in order to hide its involvement.
This story now echoes the early revelations made by Bulgarian reporter Dilyana Gaytandzhieva who reported on the use of diplomatic flights as cover for weapons shipments by the anti-Syria coalition from those countries to terrorists in Syria, Yemen, and other locations. Gaytandzhieva was subsequently interrogated and fired from her job at Trud.
The OCCRP and BIRN actually published a number of internal US Defense procurement files after their own extensive investigation. These files showed that the Pentagon is running a major weapons trafficking pipeline that reaches from the Balkans and the Caucuses but which ends in Syria, Iraq, and elsewhere. The program is part of the “train and equip” program for the SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces), a collection of Arab Muslim terrorists and fanatical Kurds mainly from the FSA (Free Syrian Army) and YPG respectively.
The mouthpiece of the Council on Foreign Relations, Foreign Policy, has covered the issue as well. FP’s article states,
The Department of Defense has budgeted $584 million specifically for this Syrian operation for the financial years 2017 and 2018, and has earmarked another $900 million of spending on Soviet-style munitions between now and 2022. The total, $2.2 billion, likely understates the flow of weapons to Syrian rebels in the coming years. . . . . . According to the report, many of the weapons suppliers — primarily in Eastern Europe but also in the former Soviet republics, including Kazakhstan, Georgia, and Ukraine — have both links to organized crime throughout Eastern Europe and spotty business records. The sheer amount of material necessary for the Pentagon program — one ammunition factory announced it planned to hire 1,000 new employees in 2016 to help cope with the demand — has reportedly stretched suppliers to the limit, forcing the Defense Department to relax standards on the materials it’s willing to accept..
As Zero Hedge comments,
It is likely that the organized crime association is the reason why the Pentagon has sought to alter its records. In addition, the sheer volume of weaponry continuing to ship to the Syrian battlefield and other parts of the Middle East means inevitable proliferation among unsavory terror groups – a phenomenon which has already been exhaustively documented in connection with the now reportedly closed CIA program to topple the Syrian government. The associations and alliances among some of the Arab former FSA groups the DoD continues to support in the north and east remains fluid, which means means US-supplied weapons will continue to pass among groups with no accountability for where they end up. Seven of the documents published by the two international watchdog organizations show clear doctoring and tampering by the DOD. In some of the original documents, one can see the end user listed. After the document has been tampered with, the end user has been removed. Wire Tapped America - New Free Book (Ad) Ivan Angelovski, one of the authors of the watchdog report, told Foreign Policy that, “The Pentagon is removing any evidence in their procurement records that weapons are actually going to the Syrian opposition.”
Balkan Insight, the website that is hosting the report, states that “Seven US procurement documents were whitewashed to remove reference to ‘Syria’ after reporters contacted the Pentagon to enquire about whether the exporting countries – Bulgaria, Romania, Serbia, Ukraine and Georgia – had been informed of the destination.”
Foreign Policy, which has traditionally acted as the cheerleader for any and all operations undertaken to destroy the Syrian government, also stated that the U.S. policy is “turbocharging” the “shadowy world of Eastern European arms dealers.” While not shocking, the reports both confirm the information documented by Gaytandzhieva and the fact that the United States is continuing to move ahead with the arming of terrorists in Syria, most likely with the idea of Balkanization and Federalization in mind for the future. At best, the terrorists being used for Balkanization and the creation of Kurdistan has taken precedence over and replaced the terrorists being used for a direct assault on the Syrian government. At worst, it is a sleight of hand by the Trump administration designed to distract and divert attention from America’s terrorist mill.

Wonder Woman’s Surprising Back Story Has a Film of Its Own,"What did you most connect with in the Marston story?
There was this incredible love story at the origin of what Wonder Woman would come to be. The Marstons were psychologists, and they really thought that if you could change hearts and minds, you could change the world. Marston called Wonder Woman “psychological propaganda” to try to get young boys and men to respect powerful women and find their power attractive. And he had this notion that if women ran the world, the world would be a better place.
Video
The Wonder Woman aspect of the story seems an easy sell. But the kink and the three-way relationship less so. Did you think you would have trouble getting this made?
I spent many a night arguing with myself, being like, “Why are you even bothering to work on this because it will never see the light of day.” But I became obsessed with telling it, whether or not it would come to fruition, because I became enchanted with the characters and the process of writing it. I really wanted to tell a very organic love story without any editorializing or winking. I didn’t want to otherize the experience of what they were doing. I made the decision, very overtly, to tell the story using the conventions of a classic prestige biopic. I thought the content in and of itself was so potentially controversial that I wanted to just treat their lives the way you would treat anybody else’s life. I feel that kink is often portrayed in the movies as scandalous and dark or transgressive. But in their case, I didn’t think it was. In the film, it’s linked to this notion of fantasy versus reality. In this fantastical world, which ultimately leads to Wonder Woman, they can be their truest version of themselves.
Frequently female filmmakers will make one independent film and not make another for years, if at all, while men may make an indie and then be given a franchise. As a black lesbian director, you made the short film “D.E.B.S,” got studio money to make a feature of it, then got to helm a movie in Disney’s “Herbie” franchise the next year. How did you defy the odds?
Nina Jacobson was running Disney, and she was an amazing mentor to me, and I don’t know if I would have gotten that job if Nina wasn’t running the studio at that point. But she loved “D.E.B.S.” and was a really big supporter of mine and gave me the job.
Photo
“Professor Marston and the Wonder Women” is your first feature since “Herbie” in 2005, although you frequently work in television. Did you find it hard to get another movie off the ground in that time?
It was less like I feel like I can’t get my movie made. It was more the stories I wanted to tell. After “Herbie,” I tried to set up a bunch of projects, and they always had strong female protagonists. I would sell them to studios, but I realized they were never going to make them. I think the actual executives wanted to, but the machinery of the industry was like, these kinds of movies with female leads flop.
But I had worked as a writer of the first season of “The L Word” and [the series creator] Ilene Chaiken said, “Why don’t you come and direct a few episodes?” It was just fantastic because there were all these strong female roles in cable. It was just when the wind really started hitting the sails of this kind of cable television revolution. And I feel like I was, if not on the ground floor, on the second floor of that.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
How did you decide you wanted to make movies?
I originally wanted to be a theater director. But I remember a long time ago I was marching in the gay pride parade in Manhattan. And around the same time the “Friends” episode with the lesbian moms had aired. I remember thinking how many people am I reaching walking down Fifth Avenue? Thirty million people saw a positive portrayal of lesbian moms through their friend Ross. And how much does that move the dial? So I became very interested in how pop culture can really move forward political progress.",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/11/movies/wonder-woman-professor-marston-angela-robinson.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Farts

'Dancing With the Stars' Las Vegas tribute,"(CNN) ""Dancing with the Stars,"" a show that by design is drenched with as much unbridled enthusiasm as it is with sequins, kicked off Monday night with a somber Tom Bergeron standing front and center, addressing the deadly mass shooting that took place in Las Vegas late Sunday.
""There's an old saying that the show must go on, and it will,"" the longtime host said. ""But first, all of us at 'Dancing with the Stars' want to send our love, thoughts and prayers to everyone touched by the senseless violence in Las Vegas. Please know that we are doing tonight's show with you foremost in our minds and hearts.""
The night's first dancer, ""Property Brothers"" star and renovation expert Drew Scott, echoed those sentiments.
Scott has lived in Las Vegas for ""a number of years.""
""It's a really sad situation but just know that we're here,"" he said after performing his Argentine tango. ""Our prayers are here for you guys, and we're here to support.""

Can You be Hacked by the World Around You?,"By Jeremy Straub, North Dakota State University
You’ve probably been told it’s dangerous to open unexpected attachment files in your email – just like you shouldn’t open suspicious packages in your mailbox. But have you been warned against scanning unknown QR codes or just taking a picture with your phone? New research suggests that cyberattackers could exploit cameras and sensors in phones and other devices.
As someone who researches 3-D modeling, including assessing 3-D printed objects to be sure they meet quality standards, I’m aware of being vulnerable to methods of storing malicious computer code in the physical world. Our group’s work is in the laboratory, and has not yet encountered malware hidden in 3-D printing instructions or encoded in the structure of an item being scanned. But we’re preparing for that possibility.
At the moment, it’s not very likely for us: An attacker would need very specialized knowledge about our system’s functions to succeed in attacking it. But the day is coming when intrusions can happen through normal communications with or sensing performed by a computer or smartphone. Product designers and users alike need to be aware of the risks.
Transmitting infection
In order for a device to become infected or compromised, the nefarious party has to figure out some way to get the computer to store or process the malware. The human at the keyboard has been a common target. An attacker might send an email telling the user that he or she has won the lottery or is going to be in trouble for not responding to a work supervisor. In other cases, a virus is designed to be unwittingly triggered by routine software activities.
Researchers at the University of Washington tested another possibility recently, embedding a computer virus in DNA. The good news is that most computers can’t catch an electronic virus from bad software – called malware – embedded in a biological one. The DNA infection was a test of the concept of attacking a computer equipped to read digital data stored in DNA.
Similarly, when our team scans a 3-D printed object, we are both storing and processing the data from the imagery that we collect. If an attacker analyzed how we do this, they could – perhaps – identify a step in our process that would be vulnerable to a compromised or corrupted piece of data. Then, they would have to design an object for us to scan that would cause us to receive these data.
Closer to home, when you scan a QR code, your computer or phone processes the data in the code and takes some action – perhaps sending an email or going to a specified URL. An attacker could find a bug in a code-reader app that allows certain precisely formatted text to be executed instead of just scanned and processed. Or there could be something designed to harm your phone waiting at the target website.
Imprecision as protection
The good news is that most sensors have less precision than DNA sequencers. For instance, two mobile phone cameras pointed at the same subject will collect somewhat different information, based on lighting, camera position and how closely it’s zoomed in. Even small variations could render encoded malware inoperable, because the sensed data would not always be accurate enough to translate into working software. So it’s unlikely that a person’s phone would be hacked just by taking a photo of something.
But some systems, like QR code readers, include methods for correcting anomalies in sensed data. And when the sensing environment is highly controlled, like with our recent work to assess 3-D printing, it is easier for an attacker to affect the sensor readings more predictably.
What is perhaps most problematic is the ability for sensing to provide a gateway into systems that are otherwise secure and difficult to attack. For example, to prevent the infection of our 3-D printing quality sensing system by a conventional attack, we proposed placing it on another computer, one disconnected from the internet and other sources of potential cyberattacks. But the system still must scan the 3-D printed object. A maliciously designed object could be a way to attack this otherwise disconnected system.
Screening for prevention
Many software developers don’t yet think about the potential for hackers to manipulate sensed data. But in 2011, Iranian government hackers were able to capture a U.S. spy drone in just this way. Programmers and computer administrators must ensure that sensed data are screened before processing, and handled securely, to prevent unexpected hijacking.
In addition to developing secure software, another type of system can help: An intrusion detection system can look for common attacks, unusual behavior or even when things that are expected to happen don’t. They’re not perfect, of course, at times failing to detect attacks and at others misidentifying legitimate activities as attacks.
Computer devices that both sense and modify the environment are becoming more common – in manufacturing robots, drones and self-driving cars, among many other examples. As that happens, the potential for attacks to include both physical and electronic elements grows significantly. Attackers may find it very attractive to embed malicious software in the physical world, just waiting for unsuspecting people to scan it with a smartphone or a more specialized device. Hidden in plain sight, the malicious software becomes a sort of “sleeper agent” that can avoid detection until it reaches its target – perhaps deep inside a secure government building, bank or hospital.

"U.S. insured wind, storm surge loss from Hurricane Nate around $500 million: KCC","(Reuters) - Insured losses in the United States from Hurricane Nate will be close to $500 million, catastrophe modeling company Karen Clark & Company (KCC) said on Monday.
The U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said on Monday that the former hurricane has become a post-tropical cyclone that continues to pack heavy rain and gusty winds.
Hurricane Nate caused flooding in Mississippi, but spared the state from catastrophic damages. On Monday, it was expected to continue tracking northeastward, moving through the Ohio Valley and into the lower great lakes.
KCC said the estimates included insured wind and storm surge losses to residential, commercial, and industrial properties and autos.
Insurers and reinsurers are already counting the costs of Harvey, which lashed Texas causing flooding that put it on the scale of Hurricane Sandy in 2012 and Irma, one of the most powerful Atlantic storms on record, which ravaged several islands in the northern Caribbean, before moving into Florida’s Gulf Coast.
More recently Maria, the most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. island territory of Puerto Rico in nearly 90 years, knocked out the territory’s entire power grid, unleashing severe flooding and causing widespread heavy damage.

The online bots behind Vladimir Putin's birthday wishes,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russian President Vladimir Putin pictured on holiday in Siberia in August
When President Vladimir Putin turned 65 on 7 October, he was not short of online well-wishers. But how many were real?
A hashtag which translates as ""Happy Birthday President"" began trending in early that day in Russia.
One of the most popular tweets using this tag is:
Image copyright @vitischeg / Twitter Image caption The hashtag translates as ""Happy Birthday President"", and the caption on the photo of the bear says ""Vladimir Vladimirovich (Putin), High five! Happy B-day!""
While the tweet was shared more than 800 times, none of those sharing it appear to be Russian speakers. They also seemed to lack the personality of an individual, were often advertising services, and with account information containing frequent typos.
""We are a professional photo servic in Vicoria an on Vancouver Island"" (sic) said one. Another described themselves as a ""Maria Arts Mrketing Guru"" (also sic).
Several also contained sexually explicit content.
Who is @vitischeg?
The @vitischeg profile also raises suspicions. The account was created in 2014 yet all tweets posted prior to 20 September appear to have been deleted. An analysis of the timeline suggests the account has stayed inactive for months at a time.
The bio states that the account holder is named Viktor Petrov-Vodkin - who shares his surname with a prominent Soviet painter. But an analysis by BBC Monitoring, using the social media tool Crimson Hexagon, shows the account previously used the name Viktor Vodkin-Petrov.
While the name Viktor, and the profile picture of a bearded man wearing shades, indicate that the owner of the account is masculine, a now-deleted tweet from 16 September uses the feminine form of a verb to describe how the account owner tried to make a salad.
This is not the first time @vitischeg has wished Vladimir Putin happy birthday. In 2016, the account tweeted the same meme of the bear but with the hashtag #PutinDay. That trending tag, as well as @vitischeg's tweets was reported on by two Kremlin-funded outlets, RT and Sputnik.

Random letters and numbers
On Putin's birthday this year, another account which shared the presidential well-wishing hashtag also raised suspicions.
This time, while almost all of the re-tweeters of the message by @YuryKuznetsov65 appeared to speak Russian, they still exhibited signs of being bots. Many of them had generic profile pictures of a logo, a landscape or a film character.
Similarly the names of many of these accounts are a random combination of numbers and letters (e.g. @NK598489, @8202ed2f4f1441a, @gda070874, or @V13155800). These are classic tell-tale signs of potential Twitter bots.
The @YuryKuznetsov65 account, was less than a day old at the time of tweeting. It claims, however, to be a replacement for @comradzampolit, a well-established pro-Kremlin account suspended by Twitter earlier this year.
Image copyright @YuryKuznetsov65 / Twitter Image caption Translation: ""Greetings comrades! I've set up what I hope will be a temporary account while I'm banned. My private messages are open, happy to answer any questions. Proof that this account is genuine is via this website. Max re-tweet!""
'Personality Cult'
Ben Nimmo, an information defence senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who studies online misinformation, says the happy birthday campaign is likely a privately run effort rather than a Kremlin-sponsored initiative.
""Bots are always hard to attribute, because they hide behind the anonymity Twitter allows, so it's not clear who's behind this,"" Nimmo told BBC Trending.
""This looks like a botnet [collection of automated bot accounts] at work, but that doesn't necessarily mean it's government-linked. The first network, in particular, looks commercial - for example, with lots of bitcoin adverts. The networks are small, in the hundreds of retweets, whereas major bot operations can involve tens of thousands of accounts. So this could simply come from a Putin fan with time and bots on his hands.
""There have been elements of a personality cult around Putin since early in his first term. Russia is due for presidential elections next year. Putin is expected to run for a fourth term, but his last re-election, in 2012, was marked by significant protests against him, and against election fraud. All the indications are that the Kremlin is desperate to avoid a repeat.
""We can't rule out some official connection here, but it looks more likely that this is a private pro-Putin initiative.""

Rose McGowan Attacks Ben Affleck Over Harvey Weinstein: ‘You Lie’,"Mr. Affleck has not responded to Ms. McGowan’s tweet. He did not respond to requests for further comment.
Advertisement Continue reading the main story
The Times emailed Ms. McGowan to confirm that she was asserting that Mr. Affleck knew about Mr. Weinstein’s mistreatment of her because she had told him, and that she was accusing Mr. Affleck of lying because his statement did not acknowledge awareness of Mr. Weinstein’s behavior.
“I am saying exactly that,” she replied to The Times. She wrote nothing further.
Mr. Affleck had been one of many Hollywood allies of Mr. Weinstein who remained silent following a Times report on Thursday about three decades of allegations of sexual misconduct by Mr. Weinstein and at least eight settlements with women. On Tuesday, The Times reported additional accusations by actresses including Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie, and The New Yorker published harrowing accounts of women who told of being raped by Mr. Weinstein.

Mr. Weinstein has denied the sexual assault accusations as described in The New Yorker and he has characterized other allegations as “off base.” But he has also apologized for “the way I’ve behaved with colleagues in the past.”
Mr. Affleck, in his statement posted to Twitter Tuesday, wrote that he was “saddened and angry” and that new reports of more serious assaults — which include accounts of forced oral sex — “made me sick.” But he did not say whether he knew anything about Mr. Weinstein’s treatment of women. Other actors, like Meryl Streep and Judi Dench, said they were unaware of the accusations, and Glenn Close said she had heard “vague rumors.”
In 1997, Mr. Weinstein reached a $100,000 settlement with Ms. McGowan after an episode in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival, according to the Times report on Thursday.

Ms. McGowan and Mr. Affleck appeared together in the 1997 movie “Going All the Way” and the 1998 movie “Phantoms.”
While several prominent actresses spoke out on Monday against Mr. Weinstein, Mr. Affleck was one of a small cadre of prominent male figures in Hollywood with ties to Mr. Weinstein who criticized him on Tuesday after the new reports in The Times and The New Yorker.
Matt Damon, Mr. Affleck’s longtime friend and film collaborator, said in an interview with Deadline on Tuesday that he “never saw” Mr. Weinstein harass or abuse women and that he would have put an end to it if he had. Mr. Damon’s and Mr. Affleck’s film careers were kicked off by “Good Will Hunting,” which Mr. Weinstein backed.
“This type of predation happens behind closed doors and out of public view,” Mr. Damon said. “If there was ever an event that I was at, and Harvey was doing this kind of thing and I didn’t see it, then I am so deeply sorry, because I would have stopped it.”

Several directors with close ties to Mr. Weinstein, such as Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez, have not responded to requests asking them to comment about what it was like to work with him. As for other filmmakers who have worked with the producer, an email to the director Stephen Daldry also received no response; Phyllida Lloyd declined to comment. And a representative for the director James Gray, who has been critical of Mr. Weinstein, said he was in production on a new film and unable to speak on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Mr. Gray said, “I’m horrified by what I have heard and any issues I might have had with Harvey pale in comparison to what these women went through.”
As more women have come forward, questions have swirled over who in Hollywood might have known something and even directly or indirectly enabled him or protected him. Roughly two dozen former assistants and young actresses have said the powerful and widely feared producer routinely asked them to his hotel room under the pretense of talking about roles or work, and then solicited massages while he was naked or wearing a bathrobe, or sexually forced himself on them.
Ms. Paltrow told The Times that when she was 22, Mr. Weinstein invited her to his hotel bedroom for a work meeting and later proposed a massage. She said she had fled in terror and later relayed the incident to her boyfriend at the time, Brad Pitt. Mr. Pitt confirmed that he later confronted Mr. Weinstein at a theater premiere and told him to never touch her again.
Mr. Affleck later dated Ms. Paltrow, though it is not known whether she relayed news of the incident to him.
George Clooney has also weighed in on the controversy, telling The Daily Beast in an interview that was published Monday night that while he was aware of rumors that young actresses had slept with Mr. Weinstein to get roles, he had been unaware of any misconduct or the settlements Mr. Weinstein had reached with women.
“I didn’t hear anything about that, and I don’t know anyone that did. That’s a whole other level, and there’s no way you can reconcile that,” said Mr. Clooney, who has worked with Mr. Weinstein repeatedly over 20 years. “There’s nothing to say except that it’s indefensible.”",NYTIMES,"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/movies/rose-mcgowan-ben-affleck-matt-damon-weinstein.html?rref=collection%2Fsectioncollection%2Farts

"Mexico warns U.S. against 'protectionist war,' peso weakens","MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican officials warned on Thursday that U.S. proposals in ongoing NAFTA negotiations would result in protectionism and higher prices rather than free trade, as concerns about the future of the deal helped drag the peso to four-month lows.
Negotiators from Canada, Mexico and the United States are due to begin a fourth round of talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in Washington next week.
Senators from President Enrique Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) said they would oppose any deal that included proposals such as setting a national quota for U.S.-made auto parts and increasing controls over the trade in fresh produce, people close to the talks said.
“We are deeply worried by what the U.S. has added recently in the free-trade negotiations,” said Senator Marcela Guerra, who heads Mexico’s Senate committee on North American affairs.
U.S. President Donald Trump argues that NAFTA has hollowed out U.S. manufacturing, sending jobs to Mexico and fueling a U.S. goods trade deficit of more than $60 billion with its southern neighbor.
Senator Ricardo Urzua said such proposals would hurt consumers who have enjoyed lower prices under NAFTA.
“Far from trying to favor certain U.S. labor sectors, this would hurt millions of consumers in the United States, Canada and Mexico,” Urzua said.
A lack of substantive progress in three rounds of NAFTA talks since August and concerns about the hardline U.S. positions has added to market jitters in recent days.
The peso currency closed down 1.29 percent at 18.4995 per dollar on Thursday, the lowest since June 5. Also weighing, solid U.S. economic data broadly lifted the dollar as investors bet the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates in December.
Guerra mentioned six so-called red lines for Mexico, including a proposal by U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to incorporate a “sunset clause” that would automatically kill NAFTA unless it was renegotiated every five years.
Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo accused Trump of seeking a “protectionist war” that would unravel the treaty that has helped expand annual trade to $1 trillion between the three nations.
In an interview published in the El Economista daily on Thursday, Guajardo, who leads the negotiations for Mexico, said the United States was considering trying to impose restrictions on companies that do business with state-owned entities.
Ending state oil firm Pemex’s 75-year monopoly, Mexico opened up its oil and gas sector to private investment with a 2013-14 reform, attracting investment from around the world.
Some critics believe state-run companies are subsidized, creating an unlevel playing field. However, Guajardo said it would be unacceptable for NAFTA to change the rules for companies doing business with Pemex under the reform.
“Imagine what Exxon and all those who have bet on the reform and have established joint investments are going to think,” Guajardo said in the interview.

Weinstein and the media's shame,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein, the Oscar-winning film producer accused of sexually harassing female employees, has been fired by the board of his company.
Harvey Weinstein has denied many of the allegations against him, but in such a convoluted and incoherent manner that it is not too soon to conclude his behaviour over the course of a storied career has, at times, been disgusting.
Now that he has been sacked by the company named after him and his brother, a cascade of allegations is swirling and many people who have been loyal to him over the years are suddenly questioning why they bothered.
It is hard not to see the allegations against Weinstein in the light of similarly tawdry claims made against the late Fox News boss Roger Ailes, Fox News anchor Bill O'Reilly, comedian Bill Cosby, and even the President, Donald Trump, who - we should remind ourselves - stands accused of sexually exploitative behaviour by many women. Those allegations are unproven and Trump denies them.
Changing attitudes to the behaviour of powerful men are driving a cultural shift, which most people will consider long overdue if it means that bullying and intimidation in exchange for sexual favours is no longer so widespread.
I wonder too if the advent of social media is making more women feel able to speak out: perhaps the capacity for an accusation to go viral, and so garner both attention and support from a vast global audience in a matter of seconds, incentivises honesty where women might previously have feared the consequences of speaking out.
But it would be a dereliction of duty to ignore that these allegations are pouring forth from the American media and creative industries.
Hiding in plain sight
The painful fact is, many, many people were aware of Weinstein's behaviour for years. He was, as the saying goes, hiding in plain sight, no doubt protected to some extent by his friendships with famous people and his ability to hand out internships to the likes of Malia Obama (who as far as we know was treated with the utmost civility). That he was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton will have done him little harm, too.
Weinstein was also protected by sheer force of character. The few times I've met him in New York he was declaiming at a party, raconteuring his way through Manhattan's most starry joints, a sun around which other stars would orbit. It's pathetic, of course, but one reason those who knew about his sordid malefactions didn't speak out is because he was their host, and they enjoyed his parties.
There is outrage in American media circles now - though many would say it pales in comparison to the outrage that attended the claims of rampant sexual harassment at Fox News. To that extent, this scandal - revealed by that other icon of liberal America, The New York Times - is in fact a test of liberal America. If late night TV hosts and their boosters in the media don't pour the same opprobrium on Weinstein as they have on, for instance, O'Reilly, they could stand accused of double standards.
Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein with his wife Georgina Chapman
Why are all these scandals erupting in the media? There's no firm evidence that sexual intimidation is more prevalent in, say, Hollywood than Wall Street. But if - and it is a big if - it is, I wonder if that's because the likes of Weinstein are part of an economy within an economy in the creative industries: they buy and sell fame.
Weinstein was the kind of man who used his power to be a gateway to both financial riches and fame: he controlled access to huge audiences, with all the money that can bring. If some of the claims made by actresses are true, it may be that Weinstein was - unforgivably - allowed to get away with it because of his power. Not just his power to make people very rich; also, his power to make them very famous.
That's the same power Roger Ailes had. Do this sexual favour for me, his sick argument allegedly went, and you'll have a better chance of ending up on screen.
If more women feel prepared to speak out, and fewer lecherous men are allowed to get away with exchanging sexual favours for fame and riches, some good may yet come from the turpitudinous exploits of Harvey Weinstein and his ilk.",BBC,"http://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-41558556

Audio Released of Hotel Worker Warning of Shooter BEFORE Vegas Massacre,"By Matt Agorist
Moments ago, a maintenance worker for Mandalay Bay came forward and noted that he told hotel dispatchers to call the police and report that a gunman had opened fire inside Mandalay Bay — well before Paddock opened fire on the concert.
The maintenance worker, Stephen Schuck said he barely escaped unharmed after Paddock opened fire on him in the hotel and he credited a security guard with saving his life.
“When the first shooting started, I was kind of frozen for a second,” Schuck said Wednesday on “TODAY.” “He yelled at me, ‘Take cover! Take cover!’ If he yelled a second too late, I would have been shot.”
As NBC reports,
Schuck said he came upon security guard Jesus Campos, who was unarmed and injured in his leg, as Paddock fired more than 200 bullets into the hall and nearby rooms at the beginning of his deadly rampage on Oct. 1. “I am incredibly blessed that somehow I came out of there alive,” Schuck added. His dramatic account, and the release of audio of those initial shots, comes amid a dispute over the timeline of the events and questions as to how quickly Las Vegas police could have learned about the massacre on an outdoor music festival.
Below is the interview in which he lays out these dramatic details.
https://www.today.com/video/mgm-maintenance-man-i-m-incredibly-blessed-i-escaped-las-vegas-shooting-1069728323827
To back up the fact that he did call in to report the shooting at least six minutes before Paddock opened fire on the concert, NBC obtained and then released an audio recording of Schuck’s dispatch call. In the recording, we can clearly hear Paddock’s first shots into the hallway.

The official story of how and why Stephen Paddock murdered 58 people at a music festival in Las Vegas last week is falling apart. As TFTP reported this week, police made massive reversals in their narrative which raised a myriad of questions and speculation. Now, we have definitive proof that a call was made warning of the shooter’s presence and his location.
Also, as TFTP reported on Wednesday, according to a report from ABC, we learned that Paddock had access to and used the service elevator at the Mandalay Bay Hotel and Casino in the days leading up to his attack on the country music festival.
Had police actually responded to the numerous reports of gunfire inside the hotel room, before the massacre began, perhaps 58 people may still be alive.
What’s more, MGM Resorts, which owns Mandalay Bay, said that while they cannot comment on the ongoing investigation, they have many questions about the timeline since “many facts are still unverified.”
“We cannot be certain about the most recent timeline that has been communicated publically (sic), and we believe what is currently being expressed may not be accurate,” said MGM Resorts spokesperson Debra DeShong.
It is entirely possible to accidentally fudge a few details of the events because of the sheer chaos surrounding the shooting and the subsequent investigation. However, the dramatic shifts in narrative coupled with the new information about how police were warned and that the shooter had access to the service elevator, do not constitute mistakes. They are more closely related to deliberate misinformation and false reports.
While many folks are opposed to asking these questions about the holes in the official story, this new information now shows that, if anything, we are not asking enough questions.

A Look at the Thursday Night Football Games,"A Look at the Thursday Night Football Games
(Before It's News)
.
.
The New England Patriots take part in their second Thursday Night Football game on the young season as they travel to face the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The Bucs are 5.5 underdogs. Before you go to casinobet.com to wager on tonight’s game let’s see if there is anything to learn from the previous Thursday Night Football games.
.
Week 1
The New England Patriots came in as 8.5 point favorites playing at home against the Kansas City Chiefs. There was no short week advantage for the Patriots as it was the league opener. Kansas City took full advantage of the Patriots’ struggling defense. Not only did they cover, they won the game outright.
.
Week 2
The Houston Texans went on the road to face the Cincinnati Bengals. They were 6.5 point underdogs. The Bengals were completely inept on offense for the second straight week. Again the road team not only covered, but won the game outright.
.
Week 3
The Los Angeles Rams entered their contest with the home San Francisco 49ers as 2.5 point favorites. This time the underdog did not win the game outright, but they favorite (Rams) once again didn’t cover.
.
Week 4
Finally the home team and the favorite won easily. They Green Bay Packers entered as 7 point favorites against the Chicago Bears. The Pack responded by winning by 21 points. Injuries finally caught up to the Bears and led to beginning of the Mitch Trubisky era.
.
A quick look at the games so far would lead you to believe that road teams have the advantage based on three of the four victories coming from the visitors. A more realistic explanation is the better defense is winning the games. The Chiefs, Texans, Rams and Packers are the better defenses, which would have you 3-1 if you simply selected the team with the better defense.
.
In tonight’s game, the Bucs have the better defense. If that approach remains, you can select Tampa and their 5.5 points tonight.

The rising profile of football in Australia,"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Football is proving popular at Borroloola, in Australia's Northern Territory
The Socceroos have won an all-or-nothing clash against Syria, meaning their World Cup dream is still alive. Qualification would be a boon for Australian football, but excitement isn't limited to the men's team, as Phil Mercer reports.
In the burning heat of Australia's Gulf of Carpentaria, even cut feet and blisters can't dull the passion of tropical Borroloola's young indigenous footballers.
They bleed for the game they love, and ache in the hope that their country can once again qualify for next year's World Cup in Russia.
Reaching the 2018 finals has become tortuous for fans of the Socceroos, who have qualified for football's biggest global party three consecutive times since 2006.
Borroloola, an outpost of about 1,000 people on the McArthur River in the Northern Territory, is one of the many beating hearts of grassroots football in Australia.
""Our kids have been playing with bare feet here on the concrete and gravel and it is 34C here at the moment. They just love it,"" explains John Moriarty. He runs training camps for indigenous children that link football to education and good health, as well as opportunities in sport.
Moriarty was the first indigenous player to be selected for Australia, and although he never played for his country, he hopes many others will.
""It is my dream to have some of our kids playing for the Matildas [Australia's women's team] and the Socceroos. The World Cup will help develop that,"" he said.
Image copyright John Moriarty Image caption John Moriarty says a World Cup appearance could inspire benefits beyond football
""In 2014 we were able to get four boys and four girls from Borroloola to Brazil for the World Cup. The World Cup just brings about magic within the community and with individuals to better their own lives.""
After a failure to progress through one of four automatic places in the Asian Football Confederation, Australia, coached by Ange Postecoglou, beat Syria 2-1 in Sydney on Tuesday.
This means the team will be on the plane to Russia if it triumphs in yet another nail-biting play-off against Honduras next month.
Australia's first appearance at football's most spectacular show was in West Germany in 1974. But decades in the wildness followed, and supporters would have to wait more than 30 years before tasting that World Cup thrill again thanks to John Aloisi's sweetly struck spot-kick against Uruguay in Sydney in November 2005.
""Everyone in Australian football knows about that penalty,"" said Luke Wilkshire, capped 80 times by the Socceroos and a veteran of two World Cups. He is now with Sydney FC, the reigning champions of the A-League, Australia's decade-old professional competition.
""Back in 2006 at the World Cup you saw football really grow (in Australia) with the A-League,"" he told the BBC. ""It's gone from strength to strength and long may that continue. Every time you play for the national team was a great moment, but the first World Cup - the first game - was a very special moment.
""We need to be at the World Cup. It is vital for football in Australia. Hopefully everything will go well for the Socceroos and we'll see them next year in Russia.""

Football in Australia has feasted on World Cup success. Its profile and reputation have soared. So have participation rates, especially among Aussie kids, and there are almost 250,000 women and girls playing the game across the country.
The government's AusPlay study, released in December last year, found football is the nation's popular club sport.
But a failure to make it to Russia could cost the game millions of dollars, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.
Champion international Australian striker Lisa de Vanna told the BBC it would be ""devastating"" if the Socceroos were denied a spot at next year's finals.
But there is another increasingly powerful force driving the round ball game down under - the national women's team. In July, the Matildas made history when they beat the United States, the current number one-ranked nation.
It was the first time the Aussies had defeated the reigning World Cup winners, and they went on to win the Tournament of Nations. Then followed two home victories over Brazil in September, with the first in Sydney attracting a sell-out crowd.
De Vanna was a goal scorer that day and believes Australia's elite women are an integral part of a football revolution.
""Everyone is jumping onboard and wanting to know about the Matildas,"" she said. That bandwagon could become supercharged if Australia wins the right to host the women's football World Cup in 2023.

""We are playing some really good football and that's what Australians like, they like winners,"" the long-serving centre-forward added.
Losers, though, can often expect little sympathy, and the pressure is building on Ange Postecoglou.
Former players have called for his sacking, but the under-fire coach has insisted he remains committed to the cause for now. Ex-Socceroos goalkeeper-turned-TV pundit Mark Bosnich insisted the coach's team selections were ""astounding"".
But Graham Arnold, the mastermind of Sydney FC's domestic domination, believes there is no need to panic.
""The whole country is behind the Socceroos,"" he said. When asked by the BBC if a failure to qualify for the 2018 World Cup would be a significant blow to the game at home, he responded in a typically forthright manner.
""Mate, you shouldn't think like that. We will qualify.""",BBC,"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41521791

Women Absorb And Retain DNA From Every Man They Have Sex With,"Women retain and carry living DNA from every man with whom they have sexual intercourse, according to a new study by the University of Seattle and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.
 
The study, which discovered the startling information by accident, was originally trying to determine if women who have been pregnant with a son might be more predisposed to certain neurological diseases that occur more frequently in males.
 
But as the scientists picked apart the female brain, the study began to veer wildly off course. As it turns out, the female brain is even more mysterious than we previously thought.
 
The study found that female brains often harbor “male microchimerism”, or in other words, the presence of male DNA that originated from another individual, and are genetically distinct from the cells that make up the rest of the woman.
 
 
According to the study: “63% of the females (37 of 59) tested harbored male microchimerism in the brain. Male microchimerism was present in multiple brain regions.”
 
 
 
So 63% of women carry male DNA cells that live in their brains. Obviously the researchers wanted to know where the male DNA came from.
 
 
 
Anyone care to guess? From the women’s fathers? No. Your father’s DNA combines with your mother’s to create your unique DNA. So where else could it come from?
 
 
 
Through the study the researchers assumed that the most likely answer was that all male DNA found living in the female brain came from a male pregnancy. That was the safe, politically correct assumption. But these researchers were living in denial.
 
Because when they autopsied the brains of women who had never even been pregnant, let alone with a male child, they STILL found male DNA cells prevalent in the female brain.
 
 
 
At this point the scientists didn’t know what the hell was going on. Confused, they did their best to hide the evidence until they could understand and explain it. They buried it in numerous sub studies and articles, but if you sift through them all you will find the damning statement, the one line that gives the game away and explains exactly where these male DNA cells come from.
 
What are they so afraid of?
 
 
 
“CONCLUSIONS: Male microchimerism was not infrequent in women without sons. Besides known pregnancies, other possible sources of male microchimerism include unrecognized spontaneous abortion, vanished male twin, an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation, or SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. Male microchimerism was significantly more frequent and levels were higher in women with induced abortion than in women with other pregnancy histories. Further studies are needed to determine specific origins of male microchimerism in women.“
 
 
 
So according to the scientists, the possible sources of the male DNA cells living in the women’s brains are:
 
 
an abortion the woman didn’t know about
 
a male twin that vanished
 
an older brother transferred by the maternal circulation
 
sexual intercourse
 
 
 
 
Considering the fact that 63% of women have male DNA cells residing in the recesses of their brain, which of the above possibilities do you think is the most likely origin of the male DNA?
 
 
 
The first three options apply to a very small percentage of women. They couldn’t possibly account for the 63% figure. The fourth option? It’s rather more common.
 
 
 
The answer is 4. Sex.
 
 
 
This has very important ramifications for women. Every male you absorb spermatazoa from becomes a living part of you for life. The women autopsied in this study were elderly. Some had been carrying the living male DNA inside them for well over 50 years.
 
Sperm is alive. It is living cells. When it is injected into you it swims and swims until it crashes headlong into a wall, and then it attaches and burrows into your flesh. If it’s in your mouth it swims and climbs into your nasal passages, inner ear, and behind your eyes. Then it digs in. It enters your blood stream and collects in your brain and spine.
 
 
 
Like something out of a scifi movie, it becomes a part of you and you can’t get rid of it.
 
 
 
We are only now beginning to understand the full power and ramifications of sexual intercourse.
